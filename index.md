### Welcome!

My name is Rylan Schaeffer, and I work at [Uber Technologies](https://www.uber.com/")
as a Data Scientist since October 2018. It's [generally advisable](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html)
to share a picture of oneself so that others will know what one
looks like.

Before joining Uber, I:

- earned my Master of Research in Cognitive Neuroscience at 
[University College London's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn)
under [Dr. Stephen Fleming](http://metacoglab.org/) on metacognition, where 
[Julius Kunze](http://juliuskunze.com), [Louis Kirsch](http://louiskirsch.com/) and I started
UCL's Artificial Intelligence Journal Club that featured 25 speakers in 9 months
from DeepMind, OpenAI, Uber AI Labs, Toronto, MILA, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton,
Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and other institutions.

- conducted research on applying supervised deep learning to DNA sequencing as
 an intern at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home.html)
 
- earned two BS degrees at <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a>
in <a href="http://cs.ucdavis.edu/">computer science engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/">statistics</a>,
where I received the <a href="photos/outstanding_senior.jpg">UC Davis Computer Science Department's 2016 Outstanding Senior Award</a>
for teaching three undergraduate courses and for organizing and co-hosting over a dozen faculty talks aimed at
bridging the divide between undergraduates and professors. I intially started in biomedical engineering,
switched to business, and then pursued a major of my own creation
aimed at studying persuasion and motivation before choosing CSE and Stats.
                
- served as CFO and COO of <a href="https://asucd.ucdavis.edu/">ASUCD</a> (overseeing a $12
million annual operating budget and 20+ units) and as the undergraduate representative on the UC Davis College
of Engineering Dean Recruitment Advisory Committee.
