## Research Questions

- Want associative memory with exponential capacity and robustness to noise

## Notes from Ila

- you don't get to choose patterns.
- patterns based on Hamming code, with parity bit checks
- exponentially many fixed points, with big basin
- uses bipartite structure for imposes which neurons can be coactive
- sparse and random weights are important for large basins
- in typical Hopfield network dynamics, bad bit doesn't have clear correcting
direction in the energy landscape. Expander allows for identifying unique correcting
  direction
