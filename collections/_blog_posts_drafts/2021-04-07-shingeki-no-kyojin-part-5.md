title: Why the ending of Shinjeki no Kyojin was abysmal (Part Three - Levi)

The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my
opinion, the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost)
every character and the story were butchered. In this Part 5, I'll cover Eren, Ymir,
Mikasa and Armin.
