- Pretty interesting guy. Was a report for the Wall Street Journal before returning
  to pursue his PhD. More details on his journey are [here](https://alum.mit.edu/slice/after-four-degrees-mit-alumnus-goes-wall-st-journal-stanford-faculty)
- Wrote free, available software to [decrypt data on DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qrpff)
- Useful suggestion: before presenting an idea to someone whose opinion you value,
  first present to several others. This (a) helps you practice the pitch, and (b) raises possible
  shortcomings you haven't considered.
- Very helpful to build a prototype before presenting an idea
- Be selfish, be annoying. Pursue what you want, and push. Don't be rude though.
- Professors are interrupt-driven. Feel free to follow up.
- Research is like improv. Responding with "yes, and..." makes the other person feel good
  and drives the conversation forward

- Graph neural networks -> just message passing with networks?
- Complexities:
  - arbitrary size
  - complex topological structure
  - often dynamic
- Rely on graph properties e.g. permutation invariance
