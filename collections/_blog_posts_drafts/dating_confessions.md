I went for a walk through Mountain View a few nights ago, passing by so many places
I used to frequent as a child and teenager: my elementary and middle schools, the downtown stores
my friends and I would hang out at after school, the parks we'd laze in over summer. So many 
memories came rushing back. I wanted to jot them down for two reasons. One, so that I wouldn't 
forget. Two, because I owe apologies whose delivery dates have long since passed.
This is part story, part confession. If the people mentioned in these stories happen to read this,
I'm sorry. There are four stories here, all about teenage romance, with leading female characters 
whose names all begin with M. I'll nickname them M1 through M4 to anonymize them. As my friends know, my memory
isn't the best, but this is what happened as I remember.

Warning: The subject of rape and sexual assault comes up.

### M1

I met M1 in 9th grade gym class. I thought she was amazing. I don't remember why, but I do remember
thinking I wanted to impress her and deciding that the best way to do so would be to wear my 
gym shorts under my gym pants and then take off my pants in front of her. I have no
idea why 13 year old Rylan thought this was the way to a girl's head, but for some reason, it was the 
best strategy he could conceive of. Surprisingly, I think it made her laugh, enough for us to start
talking. We became closer studying together for Chemistry. Not long after, I joined her 
friends group.

By 10th grade, she was my best friend. At the time, I didn't have a term for it and 
I don't think I was cognizant of my feelings, but in retrospect, I was smitten with her.
I thought she was amazing. She was funny, smart, fit, gorgeous. She had the cutest laugh.
She and I would date others, but I think I always had my eye on her, even if I didn't consciously
realize it.

The summer after 10th grade, I remember sitting with her on the sidewalk outside her house,
listening to her tell me how she lost her virginity that summer in Florida to some 24 year old
who would buy her and her friends drinks (at 16 years old, she and I were clearly underage).
I remember feeling angry, but I didn't know why and certainly couldn't explain why, so I hid
my emotions and said nothing. This is the earlier memory I have of anger and of envy.

By the end of 11th grade, I was more smitten with her than I had ever been. She and I didn't go 
to homecoming together, but we danced together, and I was so happy. At the end of the year,
I asked her to prom, and she said yes. I don't think I clearly communicated that I was asking
her with the intention of going as more than friends. This was the beginning of the end of
my friendship with her.

At prom, she spent the night dancing with another guy. On the bus ride back, we sat together,
and she could tell that something was wrong. I don't remember what we said. Not long after, she
started dating the guy. I wasn't happy. I didn't like the guy; he was a frequent drug user and 
displayed no motivation for anything, as far as I could tell. I said nothing. Predictably, she spent
more and more time with him to the point where I would barely see her. The only times she and I
would hang out were when he had bailed on their plans and she was in tears. I'd make her ramen
or buy us our favorite shared treat (Subway's meatball marinara) or maybe get gushers from Safeway
and comfort her as she cried in my arms on my bedroom floor.

The worst time was when she went to a concert with her boyfriend and his friends. She tried a 
specific drug for the first time, and predictably, he vanished with his friends, leaving her alone.
She confessed that a stranger had approached her and fingered her. I was furious with him
for abandoning her.

Rather than communicating my feelings, I ceased spending time with her. I couldn't stand seeing
her only when she was miserable. I'm not proud of this. I should have been her friend and stayed
to support her. I stopped all communication. At college, our fall semester, I guess she and the 
boyfriend broke up. I vaguely remember her calling me, crying, asking to just talk to her. I'd 
either let the phone ring or tell her I didn't want to talk to her ever again. Maybe I'm misremembering.
It's hard to know. I was intentionally blocking her out. But I am prone to hot headedness and
hyperbole and that sounds like something I'd say in anger.

I sometimes think about reaching out to her. I'm not sorry for despising her boyfriend. But I 
was wrong to cut her out and wrong to abandon her and wrong to shut her out when she asked to 
talk. On some days, I want to text her a long apology. I want to ask her how she is, where she is in 
the world, ask her who she has become. But that window of opportunity has long since
sailed. I highly doubt she cares and I don't see the utility be in dredging up the unwanted past.
The girl that teenage Rylan fell in love with no longer exists, just as teenage Rylan no longer exists.
Instead, I write this story, imagining two teenagers darting between shelves in the alcoves of my memory,
laughing together at some childish inside joke, happy in their time.
