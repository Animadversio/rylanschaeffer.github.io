Spent the whole day between three activities: studying for the impending 6.438 exam on Thursday,
my research with Cengiz and PhD applications that are due starting Tuesday.

I also learned of these famous mouse experiments by [John B. Calhoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Calhoun#Mouse_experiments)
called the mouse universe. He introduced four pairs of mice into a wonderful habitat with
unlimited resources and no predators and watched what happened. Initially, the population exploded.
Then, society began to falter. Infants were expelled, homosexual behavior increased, females began
attacking males. Eventually, reproduction and fighting ceased, and the males withdrew. This final generation
of males was called "the beautiful ones" due to sleek healthy coats unmarred by conflict.

I spent most of the day preparing for my 6.438 exam this Thursday and polishing my 
PhD applications that are coming due starting on Tuesday. I had a nice call with Aviv
today to study for 6.438 and I learned two things worth remembering. First, I learned 
that she is related to Bibi Netanyahu. She said that this is the first thing Israelis
ask when meeting her, but that Americans either don't draw a connection or are too 
polite to ask. Second, she told me about the educational environment differs at MIT from
where she did her undergrad and master's. There, she said, everyone is friendly. You all
study together, there's a Facebook group to discuss problems, many people are physically
present in a library or a lab. At MIT, she says, no one wants to study. I interjected 
to ask how we ended up with a study group of 10 people if MIT students are so antisocial.
She laughed and pointed out that it took a Harvard student (i.e. me) to get MIT students
to talk to one another.
