### A Paper From Start to Finish in 2 Weeks

Early in January, I approached Weiwei Pan, a postdoc who I had TA'ed
for in her graduate Applied Math 207 Bayesian Methods course about a possible
project that I needed her thoughts on. Through my discussions with her, I was able to
clarify the research question I wanted to ask and answer: how can one efficiently 
perform inference in latent variable time series with Bayesian non-parametric priors
over the latent states?

About a week after I had a clear question in mind, I was able to derive a result that I
wanted and implement rudimentary simulations showing that my result held numerically.
I asked Weiwei what would be a reasonable venue to target for publishing and we
quickly realized that there were only two reasonable choices: NeurIPS, with a deadline three
and a half months from now, and UAI, with a deadline in a week.

I had never heard of UAI but after some quick investigation, it seemed legitimate. Looking
at 2020, it was sponsored by Google and the Vector Institute, and I recognize many
organizers (David Sontag, Ryan Adams, Roger Grosse, David Duvenaud, Doina Precup,
Caroline Uhler) as well as senior authors of accepted papers (Peter Dayan, 
Bernard Sch√∂lkopf, Philippe Rigollet,
David Blei, Aapo Hyvarinen, Maria-Florina Balcan, Shimon Whiteson, Josh Tenenbaum,
Finale Doshi-Velez). After about a half hour's reflection, I realized 
I have too many interesting projects to pursue such that waiting three and a half months 
for NeurIPS to roll around wasn't acceptable. I decided I'd drive for UAI 2021.

To make it, I'd need help. I had already been chatting about this research direction with my labmate
Mikail Khona and my friend [Blake Bordelon](https://blakebordelon.github.io/), and when I 
explained this deadline dilemma, they both agreed we'd might be able to make it working
together. We created a list of what needed to be in the paper, prioritized the hell out of it
and got to work. We met many times that week. To complicate matters, Blake lives in Texas
which was hit with a winter storm and they lost power and water for a couple of days.
By the end of the week, after many meetings and little sleep, we had solid results and submitted.
After the UAI paper was submitted, unfortunately, I had no time to rest. My COSYNE poster was due the very
next day and I had barely started it.

Of course, the paper is nowhere near perfect, so I'll continue working on it to address 
predictable criticisms. By the deadline, I was admittedly exhausted, but I was surprised by 
the feeling of euphoria. The question on my mind moving forward is how to sustain such productivity
in the long term. I think there were a few key ingredients:

1. Short term deadline
2. A clear, immutable TODO list
   - Immutability ensures you, your supervisor and your collaborators don't lose focus of what matters
   - Immutability reduces exploration, which I think necessarily introduces drag
3. Motivated collaborators, which adds (1) camaraderie and (2) motivation to be a positive contributor
4. Frequent (daily) communication to make course corrections as necessary
5. Complementary strengths amongst collaborators
