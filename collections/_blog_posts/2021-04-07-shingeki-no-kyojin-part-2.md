title: Why the ending of Shinjeki no Kyojin was abysmal (Part Two - Reiner)

The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week, marking the end of a decade
for me. 
For over ten years now, I'd eagerly await the monthly new chapter threads on 
r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk, reading fan theories, sharing the highs and lows with others. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised myself to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my opinion,
the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost) every character
 and the story were butchered. In [Part One](2021-04-07-shingeki-no-kyojin-part-1.md), I
discussed Zeke. In this Part Two, I'll cover Reiner.

__Warning__: Major plot spoilers below for Shingeki no Kyojin.

## Reiner

Regardless of how readers feel about Reiner, I think we can all agree that his plot line
is featured prominently. Chapter after chapter, he survived
situations so ridiculous that the readers started calling him the "Plot Armor" titan.
We knew his inner thoughts intimately. As a warrior candidate, he was desperate to
prove himself. His foolishness led Marcel to be eaten, and he demanded Reiner and Annie
continue the mission to recover the Founding titan. Once on Paradis, he lived with his
enemies and realized that the people he killed were completely innocent. He returns
to Marley and is wracked with guilt for his actions. In Chapter 97, he almost commits
suicide, and in Chapter 100, he begs Eren to kill him. But time and time again,
Isayama refused to let Reiner die. Why? Why does Reiner continually survive? How will
his story end?

The answer is nothing. Reiner's character is abandoned. There is no redemption.
There is no resolution. Nothing of significance
happens. Reiner serves as a tank against Ymir's titans and later
Hallucigenia's titans. In the final Chapter 139, we have
three panels of Reiner, in which he says: (a) "Eren... What a man you are...", (b)
"Mother, I no longer have the power of the armored titan." and (c) "Historia's
handwriting is so beautiful... I can't stop looking. It even smells nice."
All three statements are cringe inducing. They honestly approach the piss-poor
quality of Game of Thrones's Jon Snow's "I dun wan it" and "Yur mah queen."

So much invested in developing a character that fades into irrelevance.
