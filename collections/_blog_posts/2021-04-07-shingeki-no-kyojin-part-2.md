The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my
opinion, the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost)
every character and the story were butchered. In this Part 2, I'll cover Reiner,
Falco, Gabi, Pieck, Connie and Jean.

__Warning__: Major plot spoilers below for Shingeki no Kyojin.


## Reiner

Regardless of how readers feel about Reiner, I think we can all agree that his plot line
is featured prominently. Chapter after chapter, he survived
situations so ridiculous that readers renamed him the "Plot Armor" titan.
We knew his inner thoughts intimately. As a warrior candidate, he was desperate to
prove himself. His recklessness led Marcel to be eaten, and he demanded Bertolt and Annie
continue the mission to recover the Founding titan. Once on Paradis, he lived with his
enemies and realized that the people he killed were completely innocent. He returns
to Marley and is wracked with guilt so deep that in Chapter 97, he almost commits
suicide, and in Chapter 100, he begs Eren to kill him. But time and time again,
Isayama refused to let Reiner die. Why?

The answer is nothing. Reiner's character is abandoned. There is no redemption.
There is no resolution. Nothing of significance
happens. Reiner serves as a tank against Ymir's titans and later
Hallucigenia's titans. In the final Chapter 139, we have
three panels of Reiner, in which he says:

1. "Eren... What a man you are..."
2. "Mother, I no longer have the power of the armored titan."
3. "Historia's handwriting is so beautiful... I can't stop looking. It even smells nice."

All three statements are cringe inducing. They honestly approach the piss-poor
quality of Game of Thrones Season 8's writing, being comparable to Jon Snow's
["I dun wan it" and "Yur mah queen."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhmGkEpkMM4)
So much invested in developing a character that fades into irrelevance.

One redditor defended Reiner's ending, writing, "Reiner Is portrayed as a tragic 
character, and similar to Eren. Both began as idealists that adapted to the brutal world
by "keep moving forward", which eventually turned them pragmatic. By a point in their arcs,
both wished for dreams that could never be true to them [...] Reiner wished to be a hero,
and eventually wished to die for his sins, yet he would not get either of them. It's a poetic
tragedy that the two are destined to be nearly exact opposite s of what they desire."

Yes, I agree that Reiner is set up to be an amazing foil to Eren. But you know what's missing?
__The consequences of Reiner's failures__. Reiner is perfectly set up to be a tragic failure.
He never gets either of his wishes (to be a hero or to die), and it turns out his failure has
no effect on him or anyone else at the end. To be a tragic character, the ending needs to be bad.
Jason from the Argonauts is a tragic character because after all his success, he dies abandoned and
alone, before being killed by his rotting ship that symbolizes how everything in his life has fallen
to pieces. Daedalus is a tragic character because his son literally dies and he contemplates killing 
himself before going into exile. In comparison, how does Reiner handle his failure? He calls Eren a
chad, says hi to his mom and sniffs letters. What would have made Reiner a truly tragic character? 
Driven by his repeat failures, he falls to his knees and shoots himself in the head. Or he exiles
himself as penance for all that he's done.

## Ass-Pulling is Bad Writing

I despise deus ex machina endings. I think a bare minimum for high quality writing
is that the rules of the universe must be consistent. The author can set up whatever
rules she or he wishes, but once those rules are established, they stand. There can
be no deus ex machina. Without this constraint, anything can happen, there's no more
predictability, and impact of whatever does happen is cheapened.

The trope of pulling material without justification when necessary to
advance the plot is called an [ass pull](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull).
In my opinion, ass pulls are a hallmark of bad writing. The problem in Shingeki No Kyojin
is that so many new rules are introduced in the final chapters. Each on its own
might be plausible, but when so many happen back to back, and ever single one is necessary
to reach the ending, it strains uncredulity.

## Falco

 __What Isayama does with Falco
is an egregious ass pull in two different ways__. First, throughout the
entire series, we are repeatedly taught that titan shifters
have specific powers, and yet somehow, Falco's Jaws titan comes with the power to
fly. We've never seen a flying titan, and
yet somehow the Jaws titan is the one that comes with wings. People will argue that
there was foreshadowing ("Look at his name - Falco!"), but that doesn't excuse
violating the established rules. There's even shoddier handwaving by Falco in which
he hypothesizes, "I drank Zeke's spinal fluid so I inherited some Beast-like powers!"
How convenient for the alliance. I also 
have trouble buying that handwaving since not one Eldian in Ragako village or
Levi's squad in the forest show any beast-like qualities after injesting Zeke's spinal
fluid. In my opinion, there is no justification for arbitrarily granting exactly one titan 
the ability to fly at the exact right moment necessary to advance the plot.

Second, __Falco masters his titan shifting abilities
the second time he transforms__ (not counting the time when he's a pure titan).
In earlier chapters, we watched how hard Eren worked to master control of his titan and
yet somehow, Falco transitions from being
completely out of control in his first transformation (Chapter 129) to being a master
capable of flying long distances (Chapter 135) and nimbly dodging at least 10
(yes, I counted) Warhammer titan archers (Chapter 136) on his second transformation.

## Gabi

I'll discuss Hallucigenia and the Chapter 138 titanization in a later post, so
setting that aside for the time being, I think Gabi is handled well. I especially
like her throw of Falco after the two are reunited.

The one nit I have, similar to Falco, is how Isayama moves the plot forward by granting
her godlike shooting accuracy. I understand that Gabi is a trained warrior candidate, so
I completely buy that she can shoot a predictably moving Eren's head at five meters
(Chapter 119) and can shoot a titan with her rifle down its throat
(Chapter 124), but how the hell does she snipe the exceptionally agile Okapi
titan from Falco's back in Chapter 137 as he dodges the archer Warhammer titans?
How does she have enough hands to aim her rifle while also holding onto the netting
on Falco's back? Also, let's not forget that Armin is inside the Okapi titan's mouth,
so if Gabi's shot is a half meter off, she'll kill Armin, guaranteeing
the Alliance will be unable to stop Eren and humanity will perish. Under those conditions,
would a reasonable character risk taking the shot? Not a chance in hell.

I don't mean to turn this post into a comparison with Game of Thrones Season 8, but in 
my opinion, Gabi's shot is less believable than Euron sniping one of Daenerys's
dragons. Euron at least had a stable relatively platform and a big target with no
collateral damage to worry about.

Someone on Reddit is adamant that her godlike shooting accuracy is well established,
writing "She picks up a rifle, and hits two KIAs with near perfect precision, and would
have hit a third if it was not for Falco. This established that she has godlike accuracy,
and is part of her character." This is horseshit. The targets she hits are at short-to-medium
range, from a stable shooting position, with predictably moving targets (or stationary, in the
case of Sasha) and no possibility of collateral damage. I don't agree at all.

## Pieck

As with Falco and Gabi, Isayama pulls something out of nowhere as needed. 
Looking back at Chapter 104, Pieck's titan is injured. Falco and Gabi pull her from 
her titan body, but Pieck isn't able to 
regenerate. Falco asks, "Her body isn't repairing itself fast enough... Why doesn't 
she have the power of the titans?" Gabi replies, "The cart titan isn't as tough as 
some of the others. It's not like the armor..." Ok, so we have clearly established 
that the Cart titan can't take a beating. Skipping forward to Chapter 136, Pieck is now
able to transform as many times as she wishes, boasting "With the Cart's endurance, so
long as they don't take me out, I can fight until we win."

Some might draw a distinction that in Chapter 104, Pieck's human form was injured whereas
in Chapter 136 her human form is not injured. Fine, but again, I despise that this
distinction is introduced exactly when the plot needed it. Additionally, this new ability is inconsistent with
her previous combat appearances. Marley uses her at long distance, with a cannon attached
to her back. If the Cart titan really is such a powerful up-close fighter, why do they
place it at maximum distance from the fight? I'm not saying that this ability of
the Cart titan is unbelievable, but too little has been done to establish this ability
such that the timing of this surprise ability's appearance is unbelievable.

## Mikasa

I'll have a lot more to say about Mikasa's character later, but while we're on the subject
of violating his own rules, in Chapter 138 and 139, __Isayama writes Eren as altering
Mikasa's memories, despite the repeatedly established fact that Ackermans are immune to
the Founding titan's memory alteration powers__. 

## Connie and Jean

Again setting aside Hallucigenia and the Chapter 138 titanization, which I'll discuss
in a later post, I have no complaints. I never expected Connie and Jean to survive to
the end, and the parallel with Ragako was unexpectedly cruel. Their deaths in Chapter
138 were masterfully delivered.
