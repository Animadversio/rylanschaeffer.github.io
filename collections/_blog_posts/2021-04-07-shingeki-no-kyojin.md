The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week, marking the end of a decade
for me. 
For over ten years now, I've eagerly awaited the monthly new chapter threads on 
r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk, reading fan theories, sharing the highs and lows with others. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised myself to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, to give Isayama time to masterfully land the story. Instead, it crashed 
and burned. The following explains why (almost) everything was bad.

__Warning__: Major plot spoilers below for both Shingeki no Kyogin and Alan Moore's Watchmen.

### Criteria for Excellent Writing

Before delving into the actual problems of the writing, I first need to lay out what criteria
are the hallmark of excellent writing (in my own opinion). There are at least two necessary
conditions.

1. Characters have motivations and act consistently with those motivations. Their decisions
   can be filled with conflict or uncertainty, they can make poor decisions, they can err in
   their execution, but they need to act.

2. A deeper meaning. 

3. The rules of the universe are consistent. The author can set up whatever rules she or he
wishes, but once those rules are constructed, they stand. There can be no deus ex machina.
   
There are more criteria for what constitutes excellent writing, but I think at a minimum,
these two criteria are necessary. Throughout its entire run, Shingeki no Kyojin has
excelled at both, but the ending did not. Character by character, I want to detail why
I found the last few chapters deeply unsatisfying.

### Zeke

At the end of 136, our heroes are surrounded, Armin is captured and everything seems hopeless.
In the alternative Paths dimension, Armin sits down next to Zeke. Unless Armin can persuade
Zeke to aid the heroes, everyone will die. The stakes could not be higher.

The conversation that transpires butchers Zeke's character. To understand why, let's refresh
our memories of who Zeke is. At a young age,
Zeke was forced to betray his parents to save himself and his grandparents. He was raised
by Tom Ksaver, and together they hatched a plan to end the Eldian race by rendering every
Eldian infertile. To execute this plan, Zeke converted an entire village of civilians
into mindless titans, killed dozens (probably more) of Scouts including Erwin, then
betrayed Marley (and later Paradis) to execute his plan. In Chapter 110, he describes
to Levi in vivid detail
how he converted the peaceful villagers into titans. Levi replies, "I can see you don't carry a
speck of guilt". Just two chapters later, Zeke converts Levi's remaining comrades to mindless
titans and goads Levi while fleeing. Why is Zeke so utterly ruthless? Because to
him, there is only one solution to the Eldian curse. There is no other option. His mission
matters so much to him that in Chapter 114, he detonates a thunder spear
in the hope of escaping. This is a man so committed to his plan that he would choose
death over failure. What could Armin say to change Zeke's mind?

Armin shares with Zeke four small memories. He tells Zeke that their ability to remember
happy past events, laden with emotional meaning, shows the value of life. If the
sole purpose is to multiply, Armin argues, then there's no need to remember events like these.
Armin reasons that because we do have these memories, life must have more meaning than just 
propagating itself. __Immediately, Zeke is convinced__. He returns to the world,
offers himself to Levi and reflects on the beauty of life before being executed.

This is a pathetic treatment of Zeke's character for three reasons:

1. Setting aside Armin's argument, __Zeke shows zero commitment to the core belief that 
   defines him__.
He throws away his euthanasia plan that he came up with, that he followed for his entire life,
that he committed so many atrocities in the pursuit of achieving, faster than I can make toast.
2. __Armin's argument is terrible__. Why do social animals have warm
memories of their family and friends? Because those memories forge social cohesion,
increasing the chance that the tribe survives. Armin's argument feeds into Zeke's rage
against life. Our most cherished memories are not even our own; it's just an evolutionary
adaptation to improve our fitness. I can't buy that Zeke would find Armin's argument a
compelling one.
3. For the sake of argument, let's assume that that Armin's argument
is indeed persuasive to Zeke. We're forced to ask: how deeply has Zeke evaluated the
philosophy at the core of his identity, if Armin's argument is new to him? The answer must
be not at all. Zeke's acceptance of Armin's argument tells us that Zeke never once
asked himself, "Is the reason why I'm killing all these people a good reason? Does it stand
up to the most basic scrutiny?" This is especially problematic because we're repeatedly
   shown that Zeke is one of the most clever characters, and yet we're supposed
   to buy that he apparently is too stupid to reflect on his own beliefs.

### The Pitiful Ending of Reiner

- Reiner is irrelevant and nothing happens to his character. He survives everything to do what? Say to his
  mom "Mother I no longer have the power of the armoured titan"



### What was the purpose of this story?



For comparison, consider Alan Moore's Watchmen, one of my favorite stories with a similarly
pyrrhic ending. Visually and superficially, the story is about superheros trying to save the
world. But this facade hides a beautiful question and a much deeper lesson. The question is,
in a universe devoid of existential meaning, how can we decide how to live? Each character
represents a different answer, and the story shows us how abhorrent each answer is.
The Comedian chooses cruel nihilism, in which anything is permissible (e.g. torching 
babies with a flamethrower) because nothing matters, but when he learns of Ozymandius's far
more extreme version of his own philosophy, his practiced cynicism cracks and he commits
suicide. Dr. Manhattan chooses predeterminism, in which everything is preordained and
we have no agency, but this belief causes him to behave cruelly to his loved ones,
and he ultimately abandons them. Ozymandius chooses utilitarianism, seeking to do the most
good for the most people, even at the cost of killing millions, but he will never know 
whether his choice was the correct one; he is left wracked with guilt and uncertainty. 
Rorschach chooses deontology, constructing a personal code of conduct that must be obeyed. 
When forced to choose between his code and his life, he gives up his life because to
give up his code would entail a fate worse than death: complete lack of meaning. The Night
Owl chooses naïveté: he fights small-time crime gangs, trying to make a difference that
the Comedian points out doesn't matter whatsoever, until he is forced to retire
and work at a deadend job. His physical impotency symbolizes his purposelessness; his only joy
in life is dreaming of his past glory. 

To me, Watchmen is so beautiful because it communicates all this complexity with plausible
characters. The internal monologues of Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandius and Rorschach,
are creative and unique, without being explicit or overly didactic. This story is so 
memorable to me because the reader simultaneously feels sadness, revulsion, pity and
admiration for each character and is left wondering whether their personal answer to
existential questions is satisfactory.

Returning now to Shingeki no Kyojin, what was the purpose of this story? What are the 
questions it raised? What are the lessons we can take away, or at the very least, continue to
ponder? I have no idea. Before t

### The Nonsensical Ending of Eren 

### The Nonsensical Ending of Ymir

### The Horseshit Hallucigenia


  
### Levi deserved better



### Inconsistent Rules

Let's start with getting the cheap stuff out of the way before getting to the more egregious,
deeper issues.

- Eren altered Mikasa's memories, despite the repeatedly stated fact that Ackermans
  are immune to the Founding titan's memory alteration powers
- Titan Shifters have specific powers, and yet somehow, Falco's Jaws titan comes with the
  power to transform into a flying titan. We've never seen a flying Beast titan, yet somehow
  the Jaws titan is the one that comes with wings.
- Falco masters his titan shifting abilities the second time he transforms, despite
  losing complete control the first time and despite all previous titan shifters
  requiring significant practice
- Hallucigenia (which has much more serious problems) survives the explosives wrapped
  around Eren's neck and the detonation of Armin's  
  
disappears despite functioning 
  independently. Seems to be indestructible (following
  destruction of Eren's neck) and has an army of titan creatures


- Complete implausibility of titans not crushing titan shifters



- Mikasa killed Eren so that Ymir learned that love is letting go, so curse is broken and Pardisans
have chance to be free
  

- Eren needed Mikasa to show Ymir that love is letting go, but Ymir is the one who gave Eren power,
  despite still being in love with King Fritz. Circular dependnency. If Ymir is following King Fritz's
  decree, she should not permit Eren and Mikasa to convince her of otherwise

Ymir was dealt with off screen when she was built up to be very important. Historia baby was anticlimactic. Nothing makes sense....

So let me get this straight . Alliance wins but also Genocide is a great strategy, actually, good work Eren

Its kinda hilarious in sad way that Eren killing his own mother is treated like some kind of footnote and immediately forgotten 2 pages later. Armin barely reacts to something this big.

- Levi's loss of purpose, ambiguity with what he's done.

- Eren monologues:

Chapter 100 "I will move forward until all my enemies are destroyed"
Chapter 106 - "Our only salvation is to wake up titan sleeping into walls and crush the world into dust"
Chapter 130 - "I will bring ruin to the world" "Only way to break this cycle of hated is to crush outside civilization into dust and wipe its history clean" saying to Historia
"I will kill them all until every one of these animal is gone" Chapter 123 His whole declaration that he will move forward until life is gone in outside world Chapter 131 "Beyond saving Eldia i wanted outside world gone because i was so disappointed"
Eren: “If someone tries to take my freedom away... I won't hesitate to take theirs”
Also eren: “i DoNt WaNt hEr tO fInD a GuY”

Just throw me out the window.



I could complain about Mikasa walking all the way back from Fort Salta to Paradis carrying Eren's head



And now the people of Paradis are all free...
To live under an authoritarian military state with a figurehead monarch, just like before.
Awesome.





People laugh about how slow Kentaro Miura is at writing Berserk chapters, but if Berserk
never ending means the end will never be screwed up, that's a tradeoff I'll be delighted to take.
