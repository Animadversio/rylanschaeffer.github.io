title: Why the ending of Shinjeki no Kyojin was abysmal (Part Four - Falco, Gabi, Pieck, Connie, Jean)

The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week, marking the end of a decade
for me. 
For over ten years now, I'd eagerly await the monthly new chapter threads on 
r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk, reading fan theories, sharing the highs and lows with others. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised myself to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my opinion,
the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost) every character
 and the story were butchered. Today I'll discuss Falco, Gabi, Pieck, Connie and Jean.
Most of these are minor characters and my complaints are relatively minor, but I feel 
obligated to point out how what happens to them cheapens the ending.

__Warning__: Major plot spoilers below for Shingeki no Kyojin.

## Falco

I despise deus ex machina endings. I think a bare minimum for high quality writing
is that the rules of the universe must be consistent. The author can set up whatever 
rules she or he wishes, but once those rules are established, they stand. There can
be no deus ex machina. Without this constraint, anything can happen, there's no more
predictability, and impact of whatever does happen is cheapened.

Falco's character was a delight through the end. But what Isayama does with him breaks
the basic rules of his own universe and made the ending feel contrived. We are repeatedly 
told throughout the entire series that titan shifters
have specific powers, and yet somehow, Falco's __Jaws__ titan comes with the power to 
transform into a flying titan. We've never seen a flying titan, and
yet somehow the Jaws titan is the one that comes with wings. People will argue that
there was foreshadowing ("Look at his name - Falco!") and there's some shoddy handwaving
by Falco ("I drank Zeke's spinal fluid so I inherited some Beast-like powers!" - if so,
why did no one in Ragako village or Levi's squad in the forest show any beast-like qualities?).
In my opinion, there is no justification for arbitrarily granting exactly one titan the ability to
fly at the exact right moment necessary to advance the plot.

An additional point of frustration is that Falco masters his titan shifting abilities 
the second time he transforms (not counting the time when he's a pure titan). 
In earlier chapters, we watched how hard Eren worked to master control of his titan and 
yet somehow, Falco transitions from being
completely out of control in his first transformation (Chapter 129) to being a master
capable of flying long distances (Chapter 135) and nimbly dodging 10 Warhammer titan
archers (Chapter 136) on his second transformation. 


I believe these tropes, of making material up when necessary to advance the plot and with
no justification, are called [ass pulls](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull).

## Gabi

I'll discuss Hallucigenia and the Chapter 138 titanization in a later post, so 
setting that aside for the time being, I think Gabi is handled well. I especially
like her throw of Falco after the two are reunited.

The one nit I have, similar to Falco, is how Isayama moves the plot forward by granting
her godlike shooting accuracy . I understand that she's a trained warrior candidate, and
I'm willing to buy that she can shoot a predictably moving Eren's head at five meters
(Chapter 119) and can shoot a titan with her rifle down its throat
(Chapter 124), but how the hell does she snipe the exceptionally agile Okapi 
titan from Falco's back in Chapter 137 as he dodges the archer Warhammer titans? 
How does she have enough hands to hold onto
the netting while also aim? And let's not forget that Armin is inside the titan's mouth,
so if Gabi's shot is even a half meter too low, her shot kills Armin, guaranteeing
they will lose.

In my opinion, I think this is worse than Euron sniping one of Daenerys's dragons. 
Euron at least had a stable platform and a big target with no collateral damage to 
worry about.


## Pieck

Again, Isayama pulls something out of nowhere as needed. In Chapter 104, Pieck's titan
is injured. 
Falco and Gabi pull her from her titan body, but Pieck isn't able to regenerate. Falco 
asks, "Her body isn't repairing itself fast enough... Why doesn't she have the power
of the titans?" Gabi replies, "The cart titan isn't as tough as some of the others. 
It's not like the armor..." Ok, so we have clearly established that the Cart titan 
can't take a beating.
Skipping forward to Chapter 136, Pieck is now able to transform as many times as she
wishes, boasting
"With the Cart's endurance, so long as they don't take me out, I can fight until
we win."

Some might make a distinction that in Chapter 104 her human form was injured whereas
in Chapter 136 her human form is not injured, but if so, that distinction is
just another amazing power introduced exactly when the plot needed it.

## Connie and Jean

Again setting aside Hallucigenia and the Chapter 138 titanization, which I'll discuss
in a later post, I have no complaints. I never expected Connie and Jean to survive to 
the end, and the parallel with Ragako was unexpectedly cruel. Their deaths in Chapter
138 were masterfully delivered.
