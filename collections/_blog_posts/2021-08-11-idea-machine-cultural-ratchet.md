This Monday, I presented three papers to my lab at MIT that I think are pioneering a unique, promising and 
under-explored approach to the study of intelligence: the cultural ratchet. This is the direction I'll be working
on with [Noah Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg) during my first rotation at Stanford, so I'm very
excited to share what this idea is and why I think it's so important.

## Background

I was introduced to the idea of the cultural ratchet at ICLR 2019 when I chanced upon
Noah Goodman's talk:

For those who don't have time to watch the video, Noah starts by asking: how is it possible that 
baby humans transition from knowing basically nothing to building rocket ships and Twitter
in two decades, whereas baby monkeys start in the same place but grow up to fling shit? Nearly all of modern
machine learning seems obsessed with scaling up algorithms, agents or architectures to take
advantage of (1) higher dimensional data and (2) orders of magnitude more data, but Noah points out,
this isn't how humans make it past ape intelligence.

The way we make it past ape intelligence is via something called the cultural ratchet. The motivating
observation is that in general, inference is intractable; consequently, if each human tried to learn
(probabilistic) truths about the world in their limited lifespan, they are bound to fail. However, 
our species has two properties. First, even if most humans learn nothing, die young or are generally
stupid, there exists a small subset of individuals that over the course of their lives learn one new
insight about the world. Second, our species is equipped with a tool, language, that allows one individual
to pass on conceptual knowledge to the rest of the species in a manner that is (a) comparably accurate
to learning the concept directly from experience and (b) takes less time than learning the concept
directly from experience. If you buy that our species has these two properties, then the implication
is that knowledge accumulates across generations, accelerating individuals' otherwise limited learning,
ratcheting up and up, propelling the human baby to master calculus and software engineering and 
aerospace engineering faster than any previous generation.
