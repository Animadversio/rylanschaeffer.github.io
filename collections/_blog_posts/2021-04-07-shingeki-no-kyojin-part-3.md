title: Why the ending of Shinjeki no Kyojin was abysmal (Part Three - Levi)

The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week, marking the end of a decade
for me. 
For over ten years now, I'd eagerly await the monthly new chapter threads on 
r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk, reading fan theories, sharing the highs and lows with others. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised myself to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my opinion,
the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost) every character
 and the story were butchered. Today we'll discuss Levi. Previous posts are linked below.
