The final chapter of Shingeki no Kyojin was released last week, marking the end of a decade
for me. 
For over ten years now, I'd eagerly await the monthly new chapter threads on 
r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk, reading fan theories, sharing the highs and lows with others. I had been very
disappointed with the last few chapters, but I promised myself to withhold judgement until
the final chapter, trusting Isayama to masterfully end the story. Instead, in my opinion,
the writing crashed and burned. I want to explain why I felt like (almost) every character
 and the story was butchered. In this Part One, I'll start with Zeke.

__Warning__: Major plot spoilers below for Shingeki no Kyojin.

### Zeke

At the end of 136, our heroes are surrounded, Armin is captured and everything seems hopeless.
In the alternative Paths dimension, Armin sits down next to Zeke. Unless Armin can persuade
Zeke to aid the heroes, everyone will die. The stakes could not be higher.

The conversation that transpires butchers Zeke's character. To understand why, let's refresh
our memories of who Zeke is. At a young age,
Zeke was forced to betray his parents to save himself and his grandparents. He was raised
by Tom Ksaver, and together they hatched a plan to end the Eldian race by rendering every
Eldian infertile. To execute this plan, Zeke converted an entire village of civilians
into mindless titans, killed dozens (probably more) of Scouts including Erwin, then
betrayed Marley (and later Paradis) to execute his plan. In Chapter 110, he describes
to Levi in vivid detail
how he converted the peaceful villagers into titans. Levi replies, "I can see you don't carry a
speck of guilt". Just two chapters later, Zeke converts Levi's remaining comrades to mindless
titans and goads Levi while fleeing. Why is Zeke so utterly ruthless? Because to
him, there is only one solution to the Eldian curse. There is no other option. His mission
matters so much to him that in Chapter 114, he detonates a thunder spear
in the hope of escaping. This is a man so committed to his plan that he would choose
death over failure. What could Armin say to change Zeke's mind?

Armin shares with Zeke four small memories. He tells Zeke that their ability to remember
happy past events, laden with emotional meaning, shows the value of life. If the
sole purpose is to multiply, Armin argues, then there's no need to remember events like these.
Armin reasons that because we do have these memories, life must have more meaning than just 
propagating itself. __Immediately, Zeke is convinced__. He returns to the world,
offers himself to Levi and reflects on the beauty of life before being executed.

This is a pathetic treatment of Zeke's character for three reasons:

1. Setting aside Armin's argument, __Zeke shows zero commitment to the core belief that 
   defines him__.
He throws away his euthanasia plan that he came up with, that he followed for his entire life,
that he committed so many atrocities in the pursuit of achieving, faster than I can make toast.
2. __Armin's argument is terrible__. Why do social animals have warm
memories of their family and friends? Because those memories forge social cohesion,
increasing the chance that the tribe survives. Armin's argument feeds into Zeke's rage
against life. Our most cherished memories are not even our own; it's just an evolutionary
adaptation to improve our fitness. I can't buy that Zeke would find Armin's argument a
compelling one.
3. For the sake of argument, let's assume that that Armin's argument
is indeed persuasive to Zeke. We're forced to ask: how deeply has Zeke evaluated the
philosophy at the core of his identity, if Armin's argument is new to him? The answer must
be not at all. Zeke's acceptance of Armin's argument tells us that Zeke never once
asked himself, "Is the reason why I'm killing all these people a good reason? Does it stand
up to the most basic scrutiny?" This is especially problematic because we're repeatedly
   shown that Zeke is one of the most clever characters, and yet we're supposed
   to buy that he apparently is too stupid to reflect on his own beliefs.
