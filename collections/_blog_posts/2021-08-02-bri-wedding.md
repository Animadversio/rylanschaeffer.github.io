My older sister Bri had her wedding today, and I had the pleasure of attending
as well as the privilege of officiating. The state of Washington 
authorizes government officials and religious figures to officiate weddings,
and it turns out that becoming an ordained minister in 2021 takes an email address
and 5 minutes:

My bathroom selfie with half my dad drives home the gravitas:

Two nights before the wedding, we had dinner on Bri's rooftop with gorgeous
weather and a clear view of downtown Seattle:

The night before the wedding, we rehearsed the wedding:

and then ate dinner with her fiance's family:

On the day of the wedding, I took behind-the-scenes photos pictures of the venue while others
were getting ready.

Bri had her makeup done

I asked Mom to pose for a picture, but she instead felt the need to fix my tie

Mom and Dad did pose for a totem picture, in honor of the Pacific Northwest

Dad was thrilled to know that DJs still have "turntables"

I don't currently have many photos of the ceremony (professional photographs
haven't yet arrived), but I do have one shot

The cake was gorgeous, topped by a "recursive" LEGO set

Dad peeked in on the stage wedding certificate signing:

At the reception, Bri seemed to be having a good time with Mom

and also with Dad

and our family friends and extended family were having a great time too

Bri and Dad killed their father-daughter dance

And I also co-MC'ed the two shoes game
