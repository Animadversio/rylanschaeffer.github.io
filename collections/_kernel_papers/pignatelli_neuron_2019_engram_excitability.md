## Research Questions

"The act of memory recall increases the excitability
of whole engram cells for about one hour."

We found that reactivation of DG
engram cells by contextual cues resulted in a transient enhance-
ment of excitability, which was specific to engram cells, immedi-
ately after recall.

## Experiments

### Exp 1 (Cellular)

- Contextual fear condition mice and tag engram neurons
- Three groups: (1) not returned to fear chamber; (2) sacrificed 5 minutes post-recall
  (3) sacrificed 3 hours post-recall
- Only group (2) showed increased excitability  
- Detected 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr after recall, decayed to baseline at 2 hr
- Same result even without conditioning; novel context C had same effect as conditioned context A
- Membrane excitability abolished by NMDA receptor antagonist before recall
- Membrane excitability decay prevented by protein synthesis inhibitor after recall

### Exp 2 (Behavioral)

- Fear condition mice in context A
- Assessed response in context AB, which had same visual features as context A but odor, lighting,
floor material, cage shape and experimental room were from context B (as far as I can tell, the mouse
  wasn't exposed to context B)
- Day 2: mice were either exposed to AB directly, or AB 5 minutes after exposure to A, or AB 3 hours
after exposure to A
- In context A, 5m and 3h groups froze at similar levels
- In context AB, no A exposure and 3h groups froze at similar levels. 5m group did not freeze

- on Day 3, all groups showed robust and similar levels of freezing
- Result held for AB exposure 1 hour after exposure to A
- Takeaway: Reactivating memory of context A within 5 minutes of context AB causes mouse
  to freeze less
  
### Exp 3 (Behavioral)

- Day 1: Expose all mice to context A without shock
- Day 2: Mice either not shown context A (no recall) or recall (either 5min, 1 hr or 3 hr)
- Day 2: Half of all three groups then shocked for 5s and other half shocked for 10s
- Day 3: test fear response
- All mice with 10s shock showed more freezing than mice with 5s shock
- Mice with 5m recall or 1hr recall had higher freezing than no recall mice and 3hr recall mice

- Takeaway: excitability correlates with easier retrieval of fear
