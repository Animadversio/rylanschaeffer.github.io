#TODO

- Typical setup: two different CS fear conditionings, separated by 1.5, 6, 18 or 24 hours
- Results
- FC2 enhanced if follows FC1 by 1.5-6 hours, not 18-24 hours
- Event 1 &2 collalocated to same engram if separated by 6 hours, not 24
- Extinguishing CS2 caused a decrease in response to CS1 if fear conditioning separated by 6 hours, not 24
- Fear conditioning increases CREB that lasts 1.5-6 hours, not 18-24 hours
- Exciting Engram 1 artificially after 24 hours before FC2 coallocates to Event 2
- Inhibiting overlapping engram impairs CS1, CS2 overlap
- To separate memories (conditioned within 6 hours), infected before CS1 then inhibited before FC2. Event two disrupted even when mice tested without suppression of FC1 engram. No effect if FC1 and FC2 separated by 24 hours.
