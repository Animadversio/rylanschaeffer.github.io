## Background

Previous work ([Rashid et al. 2016 (Science)](rashid_science_2016_competition_memory_engrams.md),
[Cai et al. 2016 (Nature)](cai_science_2016_shared_memory_engrams.md)) showed that conditioning
two unrelated conditioned stimuli (CSes) close in time would result in an overlapping memory engram. 

__Disclaimer__: I found this paper very hard to read. 

## Research Questions

## Experiments

### Exp 1

- Mice trained conditioned taste aversion (CTA) Days 5-6, then auditory fear conditioning (AFC) on Day 10.
- On Day 11, some mice had CS1 (taste) and CS2 (tone) paired during repeated coretrieval sessions (RCS)
- Control mice did not hear tone during retrieval sessions

- During subsequent CTA test, mice froze, indicating taste had become linked to fear of tone-predicting shock
- During subsequent CTA test, control mice did not freeze
