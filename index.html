        <h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

        <p>I am a recent graduate with a double bachelor's in <a href="http://cs.ucdavis.edu/">computer science engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/">statistics</a> from the <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. I was the recipient of the <a href="photos/outstanding_senior.jpg">UC Davis Computer Science Department's 2016 Outstanding Senior Award</a> for teaching three undergraduate courses and for organizing and co-hosting over a dozen faculty talks aimed at bridging the divide between undergraduates and professors. I had the privilege of being the student speaker at the <a href="https://video.ucdavis.edu/media/2016+College+of+Engineering+Student+Speaker+Rylan+Schaeffer/0_04322llo/43687952">UC Davis College of Engineering's Commencement ceremony</a>, where I spoke on the importance of ethics in engineering<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a><sup>.</sup></sup><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and I also spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64p3y0L0oEA">TEDxUCDavis 2016</a> on encouraging constructive student engagement with the Academic Senate.</p><br>

        <p>It's typically <a href="http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html">good fashion</a> to share a picture of oneself so that others will know what one looks like, so here's a shot from my most recent trip to Seattle.</p>

        <img class="photo" src="photos/personal.jpg" width = "device-width" maximum-scale=2>

        <p>My background is a little unorthodox. I <a href="http://www.uktoc.com/results.html">competed heavily</a> in speech and debate before college, and I struggled to find my major. I intially tried biomedical engineering, switched to business, and then pursued a major of my own creation aimed at studying persuasion and motivation. Along the way, I served as ASUCD Controller<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> and on the UC Davis College of Engineering Dean Recruitment Advisory Committee, as well as a number of campus committees and honor societies.</p><br>

        <p>
          I'm also currently looking for a job, so if you know of any software engineering, machine learning or data science opportunities, please email me!

        <sup id="fn1">1. The talk was inspired by Professor <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/">Phillip Rogaway's</a> <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0580/cb6c869de3b3311a4b5616c6e696755be7bc.pdf">paper</a> that I had a chance to comment on in his graduate seminar, Professor <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html">Norm Matloff's</a> boundless patience for discussing student engagement, pedagogical theory and really anything with me, and Professor <a href="http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/">Matt Bishop's</a> love of science fiction that reignited my interest in dreaming of possible worlds.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup><br>

        <sup id="fn2">2. Sadly, the previous speaker's talk on how much money the graduating engineers were about to make was much better received.<a href="#ref2">↩</a></sup><br>

        <sup id="fn3">3. Controller is a poorly chosen job title - the position was really CFO and COO. <a href="#ref3">↩</a></sup><br>
