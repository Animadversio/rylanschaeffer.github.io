    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog! I'm a fifth year computer science engineering and statistics undergraduate at UC Davis and this is my personal page to help keep track of everything I've got going on. This website is constantly under flux, so if you have any questions, comment below or shoot me an email at ryschaeffer@ucdavis.edu!

      After reading John Owens's <a href="http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html">advice</a> on having a webpage, I decided to add a picture so that people will know what I look like. This is me visiting my older sister at Microsoft:

    <h1>LinkedIn</h1>
    <p>
      I try to keep my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rylan-schaeffer/12/988/b9b">profile</a> up to date, but we all know how that goes.

    <h1>Advice to UC Davis CS Undergrads</h1>
    <p>

    <h1>History of Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      I taught a 1-unit seminar Spring 2015 on the History of Computer Science. In case you're interested in learning more about it, here is the updated <a href="articles/HistoryofCSSyllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>. I want to thank Sean Davis for serving as my instructor of record, as well as Nina Amenta, Phillip Rogaway, Matthew Farrens, Norm Matloff, Vladimir Filkov, Patrice Koehl and Lori Avellar for making the seminar possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of the 15 students in the class, 11 submitted course evaluations and 9 submitted the extended course evaluation. You can read their responses <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QGgtASCoJYZCxTJaJYoL02156iRUl2Ri_fB8Few-pnE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics">here</a>. Note: the evaluations were handwritten, so I had to digitize the students' responses myself. Some handwriting was illegible, so some information was lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      I intend to teach one course Spring 2016, either on homomorphic encryption, privacy securing communication technologies (e.g. TOR) or cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin).
