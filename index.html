    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog! I'm a fifth year computer science engineering and statistics undergraduate at UC Davis and this is my personal page to help keep track of everything I've got going on. This website is constantly under flux, so if you have any questions, comment below or shoot me an email at ryschaeffer@ucdavis.edu!

    <p>
      After reading John Owens's <a href="http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html">advice</a> on having a webpage, I decided to add a picture so that people will know what I look like. This is me visiting my older <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briannons">sister</a> at Microsoft:

    <h1>LinkedIn</h1>
    <p>
      I try to keep my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rylan-schaeffer/12/988/b9b">profile</a> up to date, but we all know how that goes.
    </p>

    <h1>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</h1>
    <p>
      I received approval from the Computer Science Undergraduate Affairs group to teach my third class, <a href="resources/198FCourseSyllabus.pdf">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a>, in Spring 2016. I am co-teaching with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinyang">Vincent Yang</a>. The term project outline can be viewed here <a href="resources/198FTermProject.pdf"> here</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>History of Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      The second course I taught was a 1-unit seminar Spring 2015 on the History of Computer Science. In case you're interested in learning more about it, here is the updated <a href="articles/HistoryofCSSyllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>. I want to thank Sean Davis for serving as my instructor of record, as well as Nina Amenta, Phillip Rogaway, Matthew Farrens, Norm Matloff, Vladimir Filkov, Patrice Koehl and Lori Avellar for making the seminar possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of the 15 students in the class, 11 submitted course evaluations and 9 submitted the extended course evaluation. You can read their responses <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QGgtASCoJYZCxTJaJYoL02156iRUl2Ri_fB8Few-pnE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics">here</a>. Note: the evaluations were handwritten, so I had to digitize the students' responses myself. Some handwriting was illegible, so some information was lost.
    </p>

    <h1>Davis Hacks: Thinking Strategically About Undergraduate Success</h1>
    <p>
      The first course I taught was a seminar for University Honors Program students on how to maximize one's undergraduate educational experience. I co-taught with with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjsheehan">Patrick Sheehan</a>. The course was based on a course we both took taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rajiv-narayan/18/b0b/72a">Rajiv Narayan</a>. I may post the material at some later date, but for those interested in the key lessons, read <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/about/">Cal Newport's Blog</a>.
