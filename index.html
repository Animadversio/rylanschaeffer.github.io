        <h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

        <p>I am a recent graduate with a double bachelor's in <a href="http://cs.ucdavis.edu/">computer science engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/">statistics</a> from the <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. I was the recipient of the <a href="photos/outstanding_senior.jpg">UC Davis Computer Science Department's 2016 Outstanding Senior Award</a> for teaching three undergraduate courses and for organizing and co-hosting over a dozen faculty talks aimed at bridging the divide between undergraduates and professors. I also had the privilege of being the student speaker at the <a href="https://video.ucdavis.edu/media/2016+College+of+Engineering+Student+Speaker+Rylan+Schaeffer/0_04322llo/43687952">UC Davis College of Engineering's Commencement ceremony</a>, where I spoke on the importance of ethics in engineering. I also spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64p3y0L0oEA">TEDxUCDavis 2016</a> on student involvement on campus.</p>

        <p>It's typically <a href="http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html">good fashion</a> to share a picture of oneself so that others will know what one looks like, so here's a shot from my most recent trip to Seattle.</p>

        <img class="personal_photo" src="photos/personal.jpg" width = "device-width" maximum-scale=2>

        <p>My background is a little atypical. I <a href="http://www.uktoc.com/results.html">competed heavily</a> in speech and debate before college, and I struggled to find my major. I intially tried biomedical engineering, switched to business and then pursued a major of my own creation aimed at studying persuasion and motivation. Along the way, I served as ASUCD Controller* and on the UC Davis College of Engineering Dean Recruitment Advisory Committee, as well as a number of campus committees and honor societies.</p>

        <p>*a poorly chosen job title - the position was really CFO + COO </p>
