		After reading Aaron's Swartz's blog, especially the posts regarding his time at Stanford, I thought it might be fun to start my own blog.  It's slightly depressing to know that Aaron Swartz was not just a better programmer than me, but also more involved and more knowledgeable about his professors entering his university than I am leaving my university.
