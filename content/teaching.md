Please comment on Rylan's teaching:

- Rylan's office hours got me through this course! I always left with an even clearer understanding of the concepts from class that week
  and how they related to the homework assignments. His sense of humor and clear excitement in the course material made those
  Saturday afternoon sessions a joy to experience very week. Thank you, Rylan!!
- Stayed late at OH on numerous occasions to help students out; awesome overall! Also just seems like a very fun / nice person. 
- I can't say enough good things about Rylan's section. I would not have passed the class without him. He didn't just answer questions,
  he basically taught an entire lesson so we would understand the homework assignment and be able to complete it. Rylan is a talented
  teacher, and he went above and beyond with how much he cared about helping the students in this class. 
- Rylan knows the material extremely well and does a great job helping with troubleshooting and overall background knowledge and
  intuition for the pset. For feedback, I would apprecaite if Ryland can move through OH in a timely manner with an agenda as OH
  usually goes over.
- Rylan is a wonderful TF. He's very accessible, and his enthusiasm for the material shows. His feedback on assignments also included
  actionable improvements. He is good at explaining things using a socratic method.
- Hi Rylan! I'm so grateful for your joy for the course material and comprehensive explanations. I can see that you deeply enjoy the
  course material which was always inspiring and uplifting for me.
- Rylan is full of enthusiasm for the material and also for teaching in general! He will make a great professor one day, I'm sure.

A private email from a student:

<blockquote>
Hi Rylan,

I don't think we've ever officially met, but my name is [redacted] and I started
[my program] this fall. I also attended your AM207 office hours almost
every week this semester, and I just wanted to say thank you so much for making them
fun, educational, and accessible!

I've been out of school for [several years] so 207 was rather daunting, and I honestly
wouldn't have made it through the class without your weekly recap of the concepts in
lecture, how they relate to the homework, and the rationale behind what we should
expect to see in our own implementations. I'm sure teaching into the gather.town 
void was difficult, so thought I'd drop a note here and let you know that you did
a great job. :)

Thanks again and happy holidays!

### Student Led Courses

In my first year at UC Davis, I had the opportunity to take a course taught
by an undergraduate student. The course proved to be the most practical
course I took as an undergraduate, and I felt inspired to pass that knowledge
on through teaching the class myself after the instructor graduated. But
there was a problem. Davis didn't have a program to support this kind of
student-led teaching. In fact, undergraduate instructors were technically
not permitted. This didn't sit well with me and a close friend of mine.
We had a class we wanted to teach. And we knew that students at other universities, 
like Berkeley, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon, to name just a few, had the ability to do exactly that.

We approached the Academic Senate and proposed a policy to permit undergraduates to design and teach classes on topics of their own choosing. After a year of researching, presenting, lobbying and negotiating, the Senate accepted our proposed <a href="http://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/committees/committee-list/coci/policies-and-procedures.cfm#studentfac">policy</a> under the title "Student Facilitated Courses." As you can tell by the section title above, we disagreed on what to call the program. I am still insulted by their choice as it minimizes the effort that student instructors put in to design their courses. Since then, I've had the pleasure of teaching three courses, two through my home department of Computer Science. All three are described below.

If you are currently an undergraduate at UC Davis and are interested in teaching your own student-led
course, please feel free to contact me after reading the
<a href="https://localwiki.org/davis/Student_Facilitated_Courses">Davis Wiki</a> page. I'm more than happy
to walk you through the process and provide guidance on being an instructor.

### ECS98 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies (Spring 2016)

I designed and taught my third class, a 2-unit upper division course titled <a href="../files/198FCourseSyllabus.pdf">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> in Spring 2016 under the supervision of <a href="http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/levitt/">Karl Levitt</a>. I co-taught with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinyang">Vincent Yang</a>. The first half of our course is based on Princeton's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> course. Lecture notes (some incomplete) and their corresponding .tex files are available <a href="https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ECS198-Cryptocurrency-Technologies/tree/master/Lectures">online</a>.



The term project specifications can be viewed <a href="../files/198FTermProject.pdf"> here</a>. Towards the end, the project morphed from "What new system would you create?" to "Present an existing system or propose a modification of an existing system." In retrospect, that should have been the project from the beginning. The projects are publicly available <a href="https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ECS198-Cryptocurrency-Technologies/tree/master/Projects">here</a>; I was most impressed by Team 2.



Nine of 23 students submitted <a href="../files/RylanECS198F.pdf">evaluations</a>. The first three questions are on a five-point scale, and the remaining questions are on a ten-point scale. Before the course began, students with little programming experience asked to add a 1-unit version of the class to learn the conceptual material; we agreed. Looking back, this was a mistake. It increased our workload, which precluded us from developing more thoughtful assignments. We also had to teach to two very different audiences, which I think was best captured in a student's following comment: "I had no idea what hashing was and never constructed a tree before. I couldn't understand how those concepts played a major role in Bitcoin. Similarly, I felt lost throughout most lectures. I'm not sure if it's because of my insufficient background, or me just not taking good enough notes." Given another opportunity, I would have been adhered to the course's prerequisites I initially set.


### ECS98 History of Computer Science (Spring 2015)

I designed and taught my second course, a 1-unit lower division seminar in Spring 2015, on the History of Computer Science. In case you're interested in learning more about it, here is the updated <a href="../articles/HistoryofCSSyllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>. I want to thank <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/lecturers/index.html">Sean Davis</a> for serving as my instructor of record, as well as Nina Amenta, Phillip Rogaway, Matthew Farrens, Norm Matloff, Vladimir Filkov, Patrice Koehl and Lori Avellar for making the seminar possible.


The two main books I used were <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15937797-computer">Computer: A History of the Information Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299652.The_Universal_Computer">The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing</a>. I also enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493321-logicomix">Logicomix: An epic search for truth</a> while searching for course material.

Eleven of 15 students submitted course evaluations, and nine submitted the extended course evaluation. You can read their <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QGgtASCoJYZCxTJaJYoL02156iRUl2Ri_fB8Few-pnE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics">responses</a>. The evaluations were handwritten, so I digitized the students' responses. Some handwriting was illegible, so some information was lost.


### UHP98 Davis Hacks (Spring 2014)

The first course I taught was a 1-unit seminar for University Honors Program students on how to maximize one's undergraduate educational experience. I co-taught with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjsheehan">Patrick Sheehan</a>. The course was based on a previous course we both took taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rajiv-narayan/18/b0b/72a">Rajiv Narayan</a>. I may post the material at some later date, but for those interested in the key lessons, read <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/about/">Cal Newport's Blog</a>.
