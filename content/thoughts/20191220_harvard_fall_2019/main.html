		<h1>Harvard Fall 2019</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>Choosing Courses</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Harvard offers students an unusual process for selecting classes. Rather than
					registering the quarter or semester prior, students spend the first week or two
					of the term fluidly attending any class that interests them. The university allegedly
					has plans to change this process since it's a nightmare for departments estimating
					professor load and the number of necessary teaching fellows, but I really like this.
					During undergrad, I had to rely on word of mouth and online reviews to evaluate a
					class before the quarter began, but here I was able to sample classes and decide
					for myself. Some lessons:
				</p>


				<ul>
					<li>Harvard is hard. My program requires us to take 4 courses (or the
					equivalent) every term. I asked a student who was a year ahead of me
					what he recommended and surprisingly, he suggested taking 3 if I could
					get away with it. He said everyone comes to Harvard thinking highly of
					themself before discovering that the other students are very sharp and the
					courses will be very hard. He then told me every student who hears this
					lesson laughs it off, thinking "That might be true for others, but I'm
					going to prove myself tougher than them all!" The student then subsequently
					gets their ass kicked and wishes they had listened to the person with
						relevant experience. I decided to listen to his advice and he
					was correct (although, in fairness, I could definitely improve how
					I manage my time).</li>
					<li>If you don't want to take a required class, fight like hell
					to get an exemption. I had a class that I was scared would become an
					uneducational time sink, and it took me until the 7th week of the term
					to receive permission to drop. But my friends who stayed in the class
					ended up hating it and complaining frequently about how much time
					the assignments took.</li>
					<li>If you can't hear the professor from the middle of the room, don't take
					the class. As shallow as this sounds, maintaining attention over the term takes
					effort and a quiet, monotone professor is danger.</li>
					<li>If the professor has never taught the course before, you might be in
					for a bumpy ride. Lectures may not wrapped into nice narratives,
					mistakes might proliferate through lectures and assignments. That said, I
					wouldn't recommend categorically avoiding new professors; I took AM226
					Neural Computation (taught by Cengiz Pehlevan) and the course was amazing.</li>
					<li>Ask the professor what his/her teaching philosophy is. I registered for
						a class that appeared to have all the right signals: enthusiastic instructor,
						amazing notes, exciting material. What I didn't realize is that her
						philosophy is to cater to the slowest student. The pace became excruciatingly
					slow and I stopped attending lecture altogether.</li>
					<li>Tell the professor what your hopes/expectations are and ask whether they'll be met.
					One professor told me not to take her course because it was aimed for students
					with less technical backgrounds. I took her advice and appreciated it.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Courses</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>AM226 Neural Computation (Professor Cengiz Pehlevan)</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						10/10. I couldn't recommend this class highly enough to my friends,
						and at some point, they started getting sick of me mentioning it so
						frequently. Cengiz is an amazing speaker. It was his first time teaching
						the course, but everything flowed smoothly. His lectures were very clear
						and he would frequently pause to explain the intuition or significance
						behind a derivation we just walked through. The course requires familiarity
						with a number of fields including linear algebra, machine learning,
						statistical mechanics, differential equations and dynamical systems.
						I especially enjoy the problem sets (psets) since they typically tied
						together derivations with numerical simulations to demonstrate how
						theory and numerical methods nicely agree with one another. Many of the
						psets are taken from publish papers, but are written in such a way
						to help you through the problem e.g. Show that A leads to B. Now, assuming
						B is true, show that B leads to C, etc.
					</p>

					<p>
						I did have a few problems with this class. First, the main teaching fellow
						was way too smart for me; I struggled to understand her explanations. Over the
						course of the term, I had to develop strategies for guiding her responses.
						For instances, I would ask about symmetry breaking
						in a model we covered in class, and she would reply, "Well, symmetry breaking
						is easier to understand in a different model that you've never heard of,
						that also won't be covered in this class." Second, at two points in the term,
						there were problems with timing such that office hours would either be
						hosted the day a pset was due or the day before a pset was due. I expect
						something like will be ironed out in future versions of the course.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>AM205 Scientic Computing (Professor Chris Rycroft)</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						7/10. My opinion is divided on this course. I was required to take the course,
						but the material seemed irrelevant for theoretical work, so I started
						the quarter with quite a negative outlook. Chris is a fantastic person in
						person. He's enthusiastic and it's infectious. I would find myself getting
						really excited, and in general, that's what I want from my professors. The
						psets were diverse and it was quite clear that Chris invests a ton of time
						creating these interesting problems. One of my favorite aspects of Chris
						is that he color-coordinates every lecture: he shows up wearing a shirt that
						matches his terminal and his desktop, and he even brings a matching rubber
						ducky. At one point, he told us that he would unfortunately miss a lecture
						for a conference, but that one of his postdocs would cover for him, and that
						we shouldn't worry because she had promised to adhere to the color schedule.
						Two funny stories. Emily Xie and I wanted to pay tribute to his enthusiasm
						so we recruited our classmates to all wear purple shirts to the final lecture
						(which would be purpled themed) to surprise Chris. But the night before that
						lecture, Chris sent out an email, saying (paraphrased), "If you haven't noticed
						the color pattern by now, I'M GOING TO WEAR PURPLE TOMORROW AND IT WOULD BE
						REALLY COOL IF YOU ALL WORE PURPLE AS WELL." Emily and I also ordered 50
						purple rubber ducks so everyone could surprise Chris, but much to our chagrin,
						we didn't check the delivery date and the ducks arrived the afternoon after
						the last lecture. We've since hidden the purple ducks throughout Maxwell-Dworkin
						and Pearce.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unfortunately, this class had strong downsides. Chris is a slow speaker, so
						slow that staying focused becomes hard. The lecture material can be
						very dry and I'd guess that the vast majority of the material (>80%) is
						irrelevant on the psets, so paying attention becomes even harder. This is
						because there's a mismatch between the lecture material and the psets;
						the lectures are heavy on proofs of behavior, convergence, error bounds,
						runtime, etc., but the psets are heavy on implementation and plotting.
						The lectures are notationally heavy (unnecessarily so, in my opinion),
						in a way that invokes confusion. I recall him defining a variable, then
						proving a result that confused me; when I asked, he showed me that in the
						intervening slide, he had redefined the variable in a critical way that
						wasn't highlight whatsoever.
						One aspect of the psets that I despised is that problems cascade e.g.
						you can't start part b without finishing part a. I feel this adds unnecessary
						stress without any clear pedagogical purpose. Some of the teaching fellows
						were also famous for giving out solutions if you asked, which devalued the
						grades in my eyes. I don't think Chris knew this whatsoever, but oddly,
						only his TFs did this. To end on a positive note, Chris is significantly
						better in office hours than he is in lecture. He's also very responsive
						and patient in responding to students on Piazza.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>AM207 Stochastic Methods for Analysis, Inference and Optimization (Dr. Weiwei Pan)</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						6/10. This was my least favorite class of the quarter. To add a caveat,
						Dr. Pan is a very enthusiastic lecturer and her slides are aesthetically
						attractive; together, many of my friends thought that this was the best
						course of the term. I disagreed. In my opinino, Dr. Pan lectures
						to the slowest student in the class, repeating the same simple points
						over and over, within and across lectures. Her presentations are poorly
						structured, content-wise, in that they fail to provide conceptually useful
						high level viewpoints that make understanding the material easy. Three examples.
						First, almost all the probability distributions covered were presented in their
						univariate forms, obscuring insights that the multivariate forms might offer.
						Second, the notion of the exponential family wasn't mentioned until something
						like the fourth week, even though it offers a concise, clean way to understand
						the distributions we had discussed up till then. Third, when covering
						variational autoencoders, she could have easily explained the concept by
						saying "autoencoder plus (variational) evidence lower bound loss function."
						Instead, she pretended that we hadn't had several lectures on variational
						inference before and started from scratch all over again. I felt like we could
						have covered significantly more material within the time limits. The
						assignments were decently cool, though.
