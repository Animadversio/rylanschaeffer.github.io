		<h1>The Idea Machine: Learning at Harvard/MIT in the Age of AI</h1>
		<div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>


			<h3>The Banana Room</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					MIT has a free banana room. If your experience is anything like mine, it'll take
					you some time to figure that out. You'll start by noticing that MIT students
					always seem to be eating bananas. You might wonder if that's because MIT students
					are hyper-focused on their academics and are desperate to get any edge possible,
					including eating copious quantities of bananas. But then after a few days,
					you'll notice that the campus
					has a clear banana gradient; when you get off the M2 line on Mass Ave, there are no
					bananas visible, but as you enter Building 7 and make your way towards Building 46
					(MIT Brain and Cognitive Science, or BCS for short), you'll see bananas everywhere
					until you cross Vassar Street, and then the banana density will decline.
				</p>

				<p>
					One day I decided to discover the source of these bananas. I climbed the
					banana gradient until I ran into a friend of mine, who coincidentally happened
					to be munching on a banana.
					I asked him what the deal was and he showed me a small room, 26-110 (that's the
					building and room number), which has tens of cases of bananas. They range from
					green to (very rarely) verging on brown, but there are so many of them and they're
					free.
				</p>

				<p style="clear: both">
					I was so excited by my discovery that I brought my story and a bunch of bananas
					back to my lab to share. One of my labmates, Mikail, said that he of course
					knew about the banana room. Jokingly, I demanded he explain why he kept it a
					secret and he laughed, saying he assumed everyone knew. I decided then that I'd
					pull a minor prank on him to get revenge. That night, at the Harvard Dining Commons,
					I took two oranges. The next morning, on my way to lab, I also stopped by the banana
					room for a re-up. I then left both the bananas and the oranges on the common table
					as bait. My plan was to convince Mikail that unbeknown to him, there was also an
					orange room. Expecting him to ask where it is, I'd tell him that he'd have to find
					it himself, sending him on a futile search across campus.
				</p>

				<p>
					The idea was brilliant, but unfortunately, my execution was not. My supervisor
					came into my office to chat and on her way out, she asked why we now also had oranges
					on the common area table.
					Gleefully, I let her in on my little prank, giggling like a young child. No sooner
					had I finished explaining my master plan than I looked to my right and saw Mikail
					sitting in his office with the lights out, having heard everything I just said.
				</p>

			<h3>Lab Life at MIT BCS</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Being the newest member of my relatively small lab (2 postdocs, 2 PhD students and me),
					I was still getting settled in, but I was appreciating one of my lab mates, Mikail,
					more and more. Mikail is an MIT Physics PhD student in his second year, and he
					impressed me with his balance of knowledge, curiosity, humility and humor.
					He had earned his undergrad in physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,
					but he told me he would've also graduated with a second major in math had the school
					permitted double majoring.
				</p>

				<p>
					Mikail had recently picked up the hobby of ice skating. In less than three weeks,
					he went from having never skated to being able to skate backwards and make small jumps,
					all by teaching himself. He was enamoured with the activity, going so far as to order
					himself ice skates and skating pants, although to be honest, I didn't understand
					the degree of his fascination. One of my friends had recently moved to MIT to start
					her Master's, so she, Mikail and myself all went ice skating and had a delightful time
					until Mikail realized he had to sprint back to make a meeting concerning the class he
					was the sole teaching assistant for. The class was actually quite amusing. Mikail told
					me that the course was an introductory physics course that non-physics undergrads could
					take to satisfy some minimum requirement. The students, he said, weren't particularly
					interested in the material, and the professors teaching the course were receiving massive,
					career-defining awards during the term. The combination of student apathy and
					important work elsewhere resulted in the professors effectively withdrawing from the
					course, leaving Mikail to handle all the grading and eventually write the final exam.
				</p>

			</div>

			<h3>Courses</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Before Spring term started, Mikail suggested I enrolled in MIT's 2.152 Non-Linear Control, taught by
					Professor <a href="http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/"> Jean-Jacques Slotine</a>). Slotine's
					<a href="http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/videos/lectures.html">lectures</a> are publicly
					available for free, so I sampled a few and liked what I saw. Slotine was decently
					rigorous, gave ample intuition, and best of all, loved his little jokes. Early in
					the course, the 2020 Iowa Democratic Presidential Primary had majorly screwed up,
					failing to release results days after the voting had finished; Slotine, commenting on
					different notions of quantifying the stability of a system, suggested that Iowa showed
					the importance of being able to bound the behavior of a system in not just space, but
					also in time. I laughed at the not-so-subtle stab, but no one else did. Slotine was
					also fond of his joke where he'd present some problem, ask how we might solve it and then
					answer, "I will use mathematics considerably beyond the scope of the class" followed by
					an incredibly trivial step such as basic arithmetic.
				</p>

				<p>
					The other course I'm taking is Harvard's MATH 110 Vector Space Methods for Differential
					Equations, taught by <a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/people/brennecke-christian/">
					Christian Brennecke</a>. More on this later.

<!--					Last term, I had befriended an Applied Math G1 student named Blake. Blake-->
<!--					was an incredibly nice guy, helping me with my homework and my term project whenever-->
<!--					I was in need of direction, and he was also significantly more competent in his-->
<!--					math fundamentals. One day, I ran into him in the graduate dining hall during-->
<!--					lunch and caught up with him.-->
