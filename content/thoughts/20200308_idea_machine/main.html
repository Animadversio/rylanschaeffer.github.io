		<h1>The Idea Machine: Learning at Harvard/MIT in the Age of AI</h1>
		<div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>


			<h3>The Banana Room</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					MIT has a free banana room. If your experience is anything like mine, it'll take
					you some time to figure that out. You'll start by noticing that MIT students
					always seem to be eating bananas. You might wonder if that's because MIT students
					are hyper-focused on their academics and are desperate to get any edge possible,
					including eating copious quantities of bananas. But then after a few days,
					you'll notice that the campus
					has a clear banana gradient; when you get off the M2 line on Mass Ave, there are no
					bananas visible, but as you enter Building 7 and make your way towards Building 46
					(MIT Brain and Cognitive Science, or BCS for short), you'll see bananas everywhere
					until you cross Vassar Street, and then the banana density will decline.
				</p>

				<p>
					One day I decided to discover the source of these bananas. I climbed the
					banana gradient until I ran into a friend of mine, who coincidentally happened
					to be munching on a banana.
					I asked him what the deal was and he showed me a small room, 26-110 (that's the
					building and room number), which has tens of cases of bananas. They range from
					green to (very rarely) verging on brown, but there are so many of them and they're
					free.

				<p style="clear: both">
					I was so excited by my discovery that I brought my story and a bunch of bananas
					back to my lab to share. One of my labmates, Mikail, said that he of course
					knew about the banana room. Jokingly, I demanded he explain why he kept it a
					secret and he laughed, saying he assumed everyone knew. I decided then that I'd
					pull a minor prank on him to get revenge. That night, at the Harvard Dining Commons,
					I took two oranges. The next morning, on my way to lab, I also stopped by the banana
					room for a re-up. I then left both the bananas and the oranges on the common table
					as bait. My plan was to convince Mikail that unbeknown to him, there was also an
					orange room. Expecting him to ask where it is, I'd tell him that he'd have to find
					it himself, sending him on a futile search across campus.
				</p>

				<p>
					The idea was brilliant, but unfortunately, my execution was not. My supervisor
					came into my office to chat and on her way out, she asked why we now also had oranges
					on the common area table.
					Gleefully, I let her in on my little prank, giggling like a young child. No sooner
					had I finished explaining my master plan than I looked to my right and saw Mikail
					sitting in his office with the lights out, having heard everything I just said.

			<h3>Lab Life: Mikail</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Being the newest member of my relatively small lab (2 postdocs, 2 PhD students and me),
					I was still getting settled in, but I quickly came to appreciate one of my lab mates, Mikail.
					Mikail is an MIT Physics PhD student in his second year, and he had possessed amazing balance
					of knowledge, curiosity, humility and humor. Mikail, I quickly learned, was a wealth of knowledge.
					Mikail had done his undergrad in physics
					at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, but he told me he would've also graduated with
					a second major in math had the school permitted double majoring. He spent a term and a summer
					at MIT as an undergraduate, conducting research in <a href="http://www.gorelab.org/">Jeff Gore</a>'s
					lab. I had heard of Jeff previously for two reasons: (1) a friend had mentioned that Jeff's course
					at MIT was the best he'd ever taken during his PhD, despite having no interest in Jeff's field,
					and (2) my boss at Uber had been Jeff's roommate while the two earned their PhDs at Berkeley.
					Mikail asked, “Did you know that Jeff graduated from MIT undergrad with four majors and a minor?”
					I looked up Jeff’s curriculum vitae, and saw his Bachelor degrees listed: math, physics,
					electrical engineering/computer science and economics, with a minor in chemistry. Interally,
					my hope that  I could one day be a professor at an institution like MIT plummeted. Mikail went
					on, “Jeff is really special in the MIT Physics department. Professors in the department don’t see
					biophysics as a real subfield of physics. Jeff was the first biophysics professor here,
					and the first to receive tenure.”

			<h3>Coursework</h3>

				<p>
					I'm taking two courses this term, Harvard's MATH 110 Vector Space Methods for Differential
					Equations (taught by <a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/people/brennecke-christian/">
					Christian Brennecke</a>) and MIT's 2.152 Non-Linear Control (taught by
					<a href="http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/"> Jean-Jacques Slotine</a>). Both are amazing teachers,
					but I'll postpone praising Christian for a later time. Mikail had highly recommended
					Slotine's course, telling me that he's basically
