# Oh, the Places You'll Go

I saw another person quoting Dr. Seuss's "Oh, the Places You'll Go," specifically the bit
at the beginning:

> Congratulations!  
> Today is your day.  
> You're off to Great Places!  
> You're off and away!  
> You have brains in your head.  
> You have feet in your shoes.  
> You can steer yourself  
> any direction you choose.

Whenever I see that, I feel obliged to remind people that rest of the poem, especially the
parts that (to me) are much more important:

> You'll be on your way up!  
> You'll be seeing great sights!  
> You'll join the high fliers  
> who soar to high heights.  
> You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.  
> You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.  
> Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.  
> Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.  
> Except when you don't.  
> Because, sometimes, you won't.  
> I'm sorry to say so  
> but, sadly, it's true  
> that Bang-ups  
> and Hang-ups  
> can happen to you.  
> You can get all hung up  
> in a prickle-ly perch.  
> And your gang will fly on.  
> You'll be left in a Lurch.  
> You'll come down from the Lurch  
> with an unpleasant bump.  
> And the chances are, then,  
> that you'll be in a Slump.  
> And when you're in a Slump,  
> you're not in for much fun.  
> Un-slumping yourself  
> is not easily done.  
  
along with

> Oh, the places you'll go!  
> There is fun to be done!  
> There are points to be scored.  
> There are games to be won.  
> And the magical things you can do with that ball  
> will make you the winning-est winner of all.  
> Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,  
> with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.  
> Except when they don't  
> Because, sometimes they won't.  
> I'm afraid that some times  
> you'll play lonely games too.  
> Games you can't win  
> 'cause you'll play against you.  
> All Alone!  
> Whether you like it or not,  
> Alone will be something  
> you'll be quite a lot.  
> And when you're alone,  
>there's a very good chance  
> you'll meet things that scare you  
> right out of your pants.  
> There are some, down the road  
> between hither and yon,     
> that can scare you so much  
> you won't want to go on.    
> But on you will go  
> though the weather be foul.  
> On you will go  
> though your enemies prowl.  
> On you will go  
> though the Hakken-Kraks howl.  
> Onward up many  
> a frightening creek,  
> though your arms may get sore  
> and your sneakers may leak.   
> On and on you will hike,  
> And I know you'll hike far  
> and face up to your problems  
> whatever they are.
