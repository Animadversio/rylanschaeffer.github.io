        <h1>Oh, the Places You'll Go</h1>
        <p>
            I saw another person quoting Dr. Seuss's "Oh, the Places You'll Go" and decided it
            was time to remind people of the part that (to me) is much more important:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done! There are points to be scored.
            There are games to be won. And the magical things you can do with that ball will make
            you the winning-est winner of all. Fame! You'll be famous as famous can be, with the
            whole wide world watching you win on TV.<br><br>

            Except when they don't. Because, sometimes, they won't.<br><br>

            I'm afraid that some times you'll play lonely games too. Games you can't win, cause
            you'll play against you.<br><br>

            All Alone! Whether you like it or not, Alone will be something you'll be quite a lot.<br><br>

            And when you're alone, there's a very good chance you'll meet things that scare you
            right out of your pants. There are some, down the road between hither and yon, that
            can scare you so much you won't want to go on.<br><br>

            But on you will go though the weather be foul. On you will go though your enemies
            prowl. On you will go though the Hakken-Kraks howl. Onward up many a frightening creek,
            though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak.

            On and on you will hike, And I know you'll hike far and face up to your problems,
            whatever they are.
        </blockquote>
