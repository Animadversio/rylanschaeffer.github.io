		<h1>Oh, the Places You'll Go</h1>
		<p>
            I saw another person quoting Dr. Seuss's "Oh, the Places You'll Go" and decided it was time to remind people of the part that nearly everyone seems to forget: 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Oh, the places you‟ll go! There is fun to be done! There are points to be scored. There are games to be won. And the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning-est winner of all. Fame! You‟ll be famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.<br><br>


            Except when they don‟t. Because, sometimes, they won‟t.<br><br>

            I'm afraid that some times you‟ll play lonely games too. Games you can't win, cause you‟ll play against you.<br><br>

            All Alone! Whether you like it or not, Alone will be something you'll be quite a lot.<br><br>

            And when you‟re alone, there‟s a very good chance you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants. There are some, down the road between hither and yon, that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.<br><br>
        </blockquote>
