		<h1>Learning at Harvard and MIT in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
		<h3>2020/03/22</h3>
		<div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Coronavirus and the Collapse of Campus</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Coronavirus came to Cambridge the same way it came to the rest of the world: it wasn't there,
					until it was. At the start of the week, coronavirus existed only in the news. By the end,
					everything had changed. Courses went from continuing to optionally online to entirely online.
					Undergrads went from living in dorms to being asked to go home to being evicted, with less than
					three days to ask their parents
