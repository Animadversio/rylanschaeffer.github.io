		<h1>Learning at Harvard and MIT in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
		<h3>2020/04/05</h3>
		<div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Remote Learning and Living</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Because my grad dorm and home department at Harvard closed, and my BCS building at MIT
					 closed, I moved back home to
					California. To support the exodus of students from campus, Harvard and MIT both switched
					to remote learning, relying heavily on Zoom. The new system has its advantages and disadvantages.
					On the plus side, lectures and meetings are recordable, I can hold private conversations
					with other participants, and I can tune out if the speaker is uninteresting or wasting time.
					On the negative side, I now wake up at 6 AM for my 9 AM MATH 110 lecture, speakers are unable
					to gauge the audience's reaction, and no one respects meeting end points. Nearly every meeting
					I've had since returning home has ran 15-45 minutes over, and people are quite shameless.
					One perk of using Zoom is that if you have a green screen, you can display background images; using
					red poster board paper, I did exactly that. So far my favorite background images to display
					include screenshots of Professor Slotine mid-lecture (left) and Andrew Ryan's
					Welcome to Rapture sign (right).
				</p>

				<p style="clear: both">
					Another difference between being present and being remote is that the likelihood of chance
					encounters falls essentially to zero. This has forced me to be much more intentional with
					how I socialize. If I don't reach out, the only people I see during a day are my parents.
					If I do reach out, I need to do so days in advance, and with specific time intervals in
					mind. It's honestly quite nice, but there's something insufficient about online interaction.
				</p>

			<h3>Distributional Reinforcement Learning</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					On Tuesday, I attended Harvard's Center for Brain Science seminar delivered by
					Professor Nao Uchida from the Molecular and Cellular Biology department. Uchida's lab
					specializes in dopamine neurons and the purported role(s) they play in reinforcement
					learning. This talk concerned distributional reinforcement learning (RL), a relatively new
					take on value-based reinforcement learning. The talk was based on the paper
					<a href="dabney_2020.pdf">A distributional code for value in dopamine-based
						reinforcement learning</a>. What were the main ideas?
				</p>

				<img class="photo" src="bellemare_2017_performance.png" style="float: right; width: 25%">

				<p>
					Most, if not all, value-based RL algorithms aim to learn the expected value
					of the return distribution. This includes the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule,
					Q-learning and all its variants e.g. SARSA. However, recent work by DeepMind
					explored (a) whether the entire
					reward distribution could be learned and (b) whether learning the full distribution
					offered any advantage over learning solely its expected value. In the first paper,
					<a href="bellemare_2017.pdf">Bellemare and colleagues (2017)</a> proposed a
					distributional algorithm called C51 that significantly improved over other algorithms
					on the Atari suite of games.
				</p>

				<p style="clear: both"></p>

				<img class="photo" src="dabney_2018_performance.png" style="float: left; width: 25%">

				<p>
					In a follow up paper, <a href="dabney_2018.pdf">Dabney and colleagues (2018)</a>
					proposed a better algorithm called Quantile Regression Deep Q-Learning (QR-DQN)
					which outperformed even C51. I'm not sure why C51's mean score on Atari seems to be
					so much lower in the second paper, or why QR-DQN underperforms C51 in the first paper.
					Regardless, both approaches claim to clearly improve over baselines.

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Over the weekend, Mikail and I discovered a perplexing result in my IBL research
					project. Most cognitive neuroscientists, or people who touch the field, will be
					familiar with the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics">psychometrics</a>.
					One common psychometric plot (indeed, so common that it's sometimes called the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometric_function">psychometric function</a>)
					is a plot comparing how an experiment's stimulus strength (e.g. the contrast of a Gabor
					patch) to the subject's behavioral responses. For my IBL project, I had previously implemented
					a function to plot the psychometric curve for my model, but the plots were strange. However,
					now that our implementation had a notion of within-trial dynamics and now that we had switched
					our implementation from one input stimulus per step to two input stimuli per step, I wanted
					to revisit the psychometric curves to see whether they looked any different. They did,
					but not in the way we expected.
				</p>

				<img class="photo" src="psychometric_left.png" style="float: left; width: 45%">
				<img class="photo" src="psychometric_right.png" style="float: right; width: 45%">

				<p style="clear: both">
					What you see here is a plot comparing the strength of the left stimulus against the
					strength of the right stimulus against the model's probability of selecting the
					correct action.

			<h3>Dating Troubles</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Before I moved to Harvard at the end of August, I happened to pass an acquaintance of
					mine from undergrad. I asked her if she wanted to hang out, but we couldn't find time
					with our busy schedules. Fast forward to Christmas break, and I reached out again. She
					expressed interest in catching up, but then when we were supposed to hang out, she
					texted to say she had come down with strep throat. I figured if she was desperate enough
					to get strep throat to avoid seeing me, I should take a hint, so I didn't push the point.
					I returned to Cambridge quite quickly, on December 30th, but we kept texting back and
					forth. Eventually, she said she was feeling better and asked if I wanted to hang out,
					so I told her that I was already gone. Nonetheless, we continued chatting until we were
					basically texting for an hour a day, every day, before bed. This continued for three
					months or so, and we started calling, maybe two or three times a week, with longer text
					conversations stretching into hours. When coronavirus shuttered campus and forced me home,
					I was quite excited to see her.
