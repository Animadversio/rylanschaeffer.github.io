		<h1>Learning at Harvard and MIT in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
		<h3>2020/04/12</h3>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Lab Meeting</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					On Monday, I made a tremendously embarrassing mistake. This week, Mikail
					was presenting the two projects he's currently involved with, when one
					of his new roommates came in through the front door into the living room where he was
					speaking. She started loudly discussing her hookup from the previous night, and Mikail,
					looking mortified, sprinted from the living room to the privacy of his bedroom.
					I laughed, not knowing karma would bite my ass within the hour.
				</p>

				<p>
					For his presentation, Mikail was presenting using KeyNote and sharing his screen via
					Zoom. For some reason, the interaction between the two was cutting off the titles
					of his slides, so Ila suggested Mikail exit KeyNote's presentation mode. However,
					one consequence of exiting presentation mode is that notifications are no longer
					suppressed and they began appearing on his shared screen. What notifications were these?
					Heather, a friend I had introduced to Mikail, had messaged both of us the
					following meme, asking which one we were. I replied, completely unaware that my lab
					would see the message and realize that I was paying no attention to Mikail,
					"Where's the horny option?"
				</p>

				<p>
					It was only after Mikail's talk concluded that he messaged us both to tell us our
					chats were popping up for everyone to see.
