# The Idea Machine
## Learning at Harvard and MIT in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

### Background

One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
\[...\] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."

### Breaking Up
The quasi-relationship I previously discussed came to an end. After three weeks of silence,
I messaged her to say that I felt her failure to make any effort at communication was equivalent
to ghosting me and that I felt this was disrespectful. Surprisingly, my text prompted her to
reply and we ended up having a conversation that neither of us appreciated, although I do feel it
clarified how other people (or at least her) seem to perceive me. She said I made her feel
uncomfortable by being always on; she said it felt like I was always thinking, questioning,
analyzing, and she just wanted to be able to relax. I didn't know this and her comment
will certainly require some introspection. The other insight I had during the conversation
is that I realized I had seen glimpses of virtues I liked and I had been trying to stoke
those into something larger. I think I need to be more mindful that I see potential
girlfriends for who they are, not what I can shape them into.

### Women in STEM Nominee for Mentor of the Year

This week, I was nominated by Harvard College Women's Center as a 2020 Women in STEM
(WiSTEM) Mentor of the Year for mentoring two undergraduate students, both of who are wonderful
and far more competent than I was at their ages. I had gotten involved in WiSTEM in a bit
of an odd way. In Fall Term, I receive an email sent out to all of SEAS asking for volunteer
mentors. I asked if there was anything prohibiting men from volunteering, and the leadership
said no one had previously inquired. After a few days, I received an email saying I was
welcome to participate as a mentor. When I went to the first large meeting, two of my
program mates were there and they immediately burst out laughing. They asked what I was doing
there and thought I was joking when I said I had two mentees. I was so tempted to
tell them, but thought better of it. When I reread the Nominated Mentor of the Year email,
I couldn't stop laughing. The email contained testimony from ten of the twelve
nominees' mentees, lauding what each of the mentors had done, and I was not one of the
twelve. I wonder if one of my mentees was playing a prank on me :)

One of my mentees, Alyssa, knows all kinds of surprises around campus. One night,
she, my other mentee and me met to have s'mores at the fireplaces in the Plaza
outside the Science Center. The s'more truck was closed, unfortunately, and
before long, not even the fires could keep us warm from the biting cold. Alyssa
asked if we wanted to see the Harvard observatory. She took us inside the Science
Center, up a few stairs, into a little room at the top that had a massive telescope.
The wall was covered in comics, including one Bloom County that I remembered
from my childhood. The view from the rooftop overlooking the campus was beautiful.
