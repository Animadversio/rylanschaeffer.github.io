			Dear Animorphs Readers:<br><br>

			Quite a number of people seem to be annoyed by the final chapter in the Animorphs story.
			There are a lot of complaints that I let Rachel die. That I let Visser Three/One live.
			That Cassie and Jake broke up. That Tobias seems to have been reduced to unexpressed
			grief. That there was no grand, final fight-to-end-all-fights. That there was no happy
			celebration. And everyone is mad about the cliffhanger ending.<br><br>

			So I thought I'd respond.<br><br>

			Animorphs was always a war story. Wars don't end happily. Not ever. Often relationships
			that were central during war, dissolve during peace. Some people who were brave and
			fearless in war are unable to handle peace, feel disconnected and confused. Other times
			people in war make the move to peace very easily. Always people die in wars. And always
			people are left shattered by the loss of loved ones.<br><br>

			That's what happens, so that's what I wrote. Jake and Cassie were in love during the
			war, and end up going their seperate ways afterward. Jake, who was so brave and
			capable during the war is adrift during the peace. Marco and Ax, on the other hand,
			move easily past the war and even manage to use their experience to good effect.
			Rachel dies, and Tobias will never get over it. That doesn't by any means cover
			everything that happens in a war, but it's a start.<br><br>

			Here's what doesn't happen in war: there are no wondrous, climactic battles that leave
			the good guys standing tall and the bad guys lying in the dirt. Life isn't a World
			Wrestling Federation Smackdown. Even the people who win a war, who survive and come out
			the other side with the conviction that they have done something brave and necessary,
			don't do a lot of celebrating. There's very little chanting of 'we're number one' among
			people who've personally experienced war.<br><br>

			I'm just a writer, and my main goal was always to entertain. But I've never let Animorphs
			turn into just another painless video game version of war, and I wasn't going to do it
			at the end. I've spent 60 books telling a strange, fanciful war story, sometimes very
			seriously, sometimes more tongue-in-cheek. I've written a lot of action and a lot of
			humor and a lot of sheer nonsense. But I have also, again and again, challenged readers
			to think about what they were reading. To think about the right and wrong, not just the
			who-beat-who. And to tell you the truth I'm a little shocked that so many readers seemed
			to believe I'd wrap it all up with a lot of high-fiving and backslapping. Wars very
			often end, sad to say, just as ours did: with a nearly seamless transition to another
			war.<br><br>

			So, you don't like the way our little fictional war came out? You don't like Rachel dead
			and Tobias shattered and Jake guilt-ridden? You don't like that one war simply led to
			another? Fine. Pretty soon you'll all be of voting age, and of draft age. So when someone
			proposes a war, remember that even the most necessary wars, even the rare wars where the
			lines of good and evil are clear and clean, end with a lot of people dead, a lot of
			people crippled, and a lot of orphans, widows and grieving parents.<br><br>

			If you're mad at me because that's what you have to take away from Animorphs, too bad.
			I couldn't have written it any other way and remained true to the respect I have
			always felt for Animorphs readers.<br><br>
