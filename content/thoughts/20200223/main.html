		<h1>The Idea Machine: Learning at Harvard/MIT in the Age of AI</h1>
		<div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					One of my favorite books is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-factory">
					The Idea Factory: Learning to Think at MIT</a> by Pepper White. It tells Pepper's story
					as a student earning his Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in the 1980s,
					capturing his research, experiences and feelings of inadequacy first-hand. Forty years
					later, as a Master's student at Harvard conducting research in MIT's Brain and Cognitive
					Science Department, these posts are my stories, inspired by Pepper and in tribute to
					those who came before. To paraphrase my favorite quote, "If I could see [...] an insight,
					a new way of looking at it that would maybe, just maybe, find its way into future generations
					[...] In the Eiffel tower of technology, I would be a rivet."
				</p>
			</div>


			<h3>The Banana Room</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					MIT has a free banana room. If your experience is anything like mine, it'll take
					you some time to figure that out. You'll start by noticing that MIT students
					always seem to be eating bananas. You might wonder if that's because MIT students
					are hyper-focused on their academics and are desperate to get any edge possible,
					including eating copious quantities of bananas. But then after a few days,
					you'll notice that the campus
					has a clear banana gradient; when you get off the M2 line on Mass Ave, there are no
					bananas visible, but as you enter Building 7 and make your way towards Building 46
					(MIT Brain and Cognitive Science, or BCS for short), you'll see bananas everywhere
					until you cross Vassar Street, and then the banana density will decline.
				</p>

				<p>
					One day I decided to discover the source of these bananas. I climbed the
					banana gradient until I ran into a friend of mine, who coincidentally happened
					to be munching on a banana.
					I asked him what the deal was and he showed me a small room, 26-110 (that's the
					building and room number), which has tens of cases of bananas. They range from
					green to (very rarely) verging on brown, but
