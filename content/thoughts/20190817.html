        <h1>Taglit-Birthright</h1>

        <p>
            I spent the past two weeks traveling across Israel as part of
            <a href="https://www.birthrightisrael.com/about_us">Taglit Birthright Israel</a>
            on Bus 657 with approximately 40 Americans and 10 Israelis. Our trip was hosted by
            <a href="https://www.israelwithisraelis.com/">Shorashim</a>, which differs from most
            trips in that our Israelis traveled with us for the entire trip. As described on the
            Birthright Israel website, "Birthright Israel aims to strengthen Jewish identity,
            Jewish communities, and connection with Israel and its people." The following is my
            recollection of the trip and its highlights.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1 - Afik Kibbutz Orchan and Shehecheyanu Ceremony</h2>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/itamar_bouton.jpg" style="float:left; width: 15%">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day01_route.png" style="float:right; width: 35%">
            We were greeted at the airport by our Israeli participants and our Israeli guide,
            <a href="http://boutontour.com/">Itamar Bouton</a>, who would prove himself to
            be an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and humorous leader over the course of the trip. He gave three
            simple rules to follow: don't be stupid, don't be a jerk, and don't be late!
        <p></p>

        <p>
            We immediately left Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, heading Northeast to
            an Israeli settlement in the
            Golan Heights called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afik">Afik</a>,
            where we spent the first two nights at our first Kibbutz. Unbeknownst to me at the time,
            Wikipedia states that the kibbutz is the first Israeli kibbutz in Golan Heights and is
            considered an illegal settlement under international law. I was unable to learn when
            the kibbutz was established, but the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-golan-heights">Jewish Virtual Library</a>
            suggests that kibbutzim in the Golan Heights predate Israeli control, although no
            kibbutz was in Afik prior to Israel capturing the Golan Heights during the Six Day War.
        </p>

        <p>
            The kibbutz was lush and gorgeous. I was surprised to learn that the
            history of kibbutzim in Israel is closely intertwined with Marxist/Communist elements;
            one of the pioneers wrote that, "We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew
            more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was
            not the way we hoped to settle the countryâ€”this old way with Jews on top and Arabs
            working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed
            at all. There must be a better way." Decisions are made communally and (at least
            historically) resources and chores were shared. The captial necessary to purchase land
            came in the form of small donations from Jews across Europe.
        </p>

            Our guide Itamar gave us a preview of where we would travel and what we would do over
            the course of the trip, using Ben as a makeshift map of Israel. The final activity
            of the day was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">Shehecheyanu</a>
            during sunset. Shehecheyanu is a common Jewish prayer used to celebrate new experiences.

        <h2 style="clear: both;">Day 2 - Hiking, Golan Heights and Rafting</h2>

        <p>
            On Day 2, an 18-year old Israeli named Dvir Sorek was killed by two Palestinians, one
            who was a member of Hamas, a constant reminder of the security challenges facing Israel. Sorek was
            stabbed to death in his West Bank settlement of Migdal Oz, where he was a seminary and
            military student. His body was discovered the next morning and
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-nabs-the-two-suspected-killers-of-dvir-sorek-one-has-hamas-ties/">his killers were captured alive within three days</a>.
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-and-islamic-jihad-praise-heroic-west-bank-slaying-of-student/">Hamas claimed</a>
            that the attack was retaliation for Israeli destruction of Palestinian residential buildings
            in late July 2019. Over breakfast, we asked one of the Israelis traveling with us for her
            perspective regarding Palestinians and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), and one comment she
            made stuck with me: she claimed that the IDF is exclusively a defense force and as
            justification, she emphasized that the word "defense" is the "D" in "IDF." A disappointing
            answer. Days later, I would learn that she herself is from a West Bank settlement called
            Adora, which was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Adora_terrorist_attack">attacked during the second intifada</a>.
            Four of her townspeople were killed when two attackers dressed as IDF soldiers, cut
            through the security fence and went house to house shooting children while families
            were praying for Shabbat. One of the dead was a young girl close in age to my Israeli
            companion. An attacker was later released as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit_prisoner_exchange">a trade for an IDF prisoner of war</a>.
        </p>

            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day02_hike.jpg" style="float: left; width: 25%">
            To start the day, we went for a nice hike. Halfway through the hike, we encountered a
            delightful pond that we went swimming in. Our wet clothes proved to be a good defense
            against the growing heat of the day. As we passed over all kinds of interesting rocks,
            we learned that the Golan Heights was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights#Geology">formerly seismically active</a>.
            Consequently, the mountains that were formed act as a watershed that funnels
            clean rainwater into the Sea of Galilee, where it can be used for drinking and
            agriculture. This clarified why Israel is so determined to hold onto the Golan
            Heights; in a war, Syria could cut off roughly 10% of Israel's water supply, and
            indeed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headwater_Diversion_Plan_(Jordan_River)">Arab League</a>
            tried to do exactly that leading up to the Six Day War.

            <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/">Yad Vashem</a> is Israel's Holocaust Memorial.
            Photos aren't permitted inside, so I have very few. I'll share one photo that I snuck
            because the story touched me. As the picture reads, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Robota">Roza Robota</a>
            was interned at Auschwitz where she smuggled explosives to resistance fighters
            who used her explosives to destroy one of the crematoriums. While her courage was
            commendable, the reason her memory stayed with me was that when she was captured,
            she refused to name her co-conspirators, even under torture. As I
            stood in the memorial, I imagined that her story was the inspiration for Evey's
            torture scene in V for Vendetta, a scene in which a woman condemned to die in a concentration
            camp realizes that her integrity matters more to her than her life. I can't do the
            scene justice in words, but it's one of the most moving film scenes I've seen:
