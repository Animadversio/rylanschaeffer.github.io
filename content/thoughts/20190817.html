        <h1>Taglit-Birthright</h1>

        <p>
            I spent the past two weeks traveling across Israel as part of
            <a href="https://www.birthrightisrael.com/about_us">Taglit Birthright Israel</a>
            on Bus 657 with approximately 40 Americans and 10 Israelis. Our trip was hosted by
            <a href="https://www.israelwithisraelis.com/">Shorashim</a>, which differs from most
            trips in that our Israelis traveled with us for the entire trip. As described on the
            Birthright Israel website, "Birthright Israel aims to strengthen Jewish identity,
            Jewish communities, and connection with Israel and its people." The following is my
            recollection of the trip and its highlights.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1 - Afik Kibbutz Orchan and Shehecheyanu Ceremony</h2>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/itamar_bouton.jpg" style="float:left; width: 15%">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day01_route.png" style="float:right; width: 15%">
            We were greeted at the airport by our Israeli participants and our Israeli guide,
            <a href="http://boutontour.com/">Itamar Bouton</a>, who would prove himself to
            be an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and humorous leader over the course of the trip. He gave three
            simple rules to follow: don't be stupid, don't be a jerk, and don't be late!
        </p>

        <p>
            We immediately left Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, heading Northeast to
            an Israeli settlement in the
            Golan Heights called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afik">Afik</a>,
            where we spent the first two nights at our first Kibbutz. Unbeknownst to me at the time,
            Wikipedia states that the kibbutz is the first Israeli kibbutz in Golan Heights and is
            considered an illegal settlement under international law. I was unable to learn when
            the kibbutz was established, but the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-golan-heights">Jewish Virtual Library</a>
            suggests that kibbutzim in the Golan Heights predate Israeli control, although no
            kibbutz was in Afik prior to Israel capturing the Golan Heights during the Six Day War.
        </p>

        <p style="clear: both">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day01_kibbutz_afik.jpg" style="float:left">
        </p>

        <p>
            The kibbutz was lush and gorgeous. I was surprised to learn that the
            history of kibbutzim in Israel is closely intertwined with Marxist/Communist elements;
            one of the pioneers wrote that, "We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew
            more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was
            not the way we hoped to settle the countryâ€”this old way with Jews on top and Arabs
            working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed
            at all. There must be a better way." Decisions are made communally and (at least
            historically) resources and chores were shared. The captial necessary to purchase land
            came in the form of small donations from Jews across Europe.
        </p>

            Our guide Itamar gave us a preview of where we would travel and what we would do over
            the course of the trip, using Ben as a makeshift map of Israel. The final activity
            of the day was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">Shehecheyanu</a>
            during sunset. Shehecheyanu is a common Jewish prayer used to celebrate new experiences.

        <h2 style="clear: both;">Day 2 - Hiking, Golan Heights and Rafting</h2>

        <p>
            On Day 2, an 18-year old Israeli named Dvir Sorek was killed by two Palestinians, one
            who was a member of Hamas, a constant reminder of the security challenges facing Israel. Sorek was
            stabbed to death in his West Bank settlement of Migdal Oz, where he was a seminary and
            military student. His body was discovered the next morning and
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-nabs-the-two-suspected-killers-of-dvir-sorek-one-has-hamas-ties/">his killers were captured alive within three days</a>.
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-and-islamic-jihad-praise-heroic-west-bank-slaying-of-student/">Hamas claimed</a>
            that the attack was retaliation for Israeli destruction of Palestinian residential buildings
            in late July 2019. Over breakfast, we asked one of the Israelis traveling with us for her
            perspective regarding Palestinians and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), and one comment she
            made stuck with me: she claimed that the IDF is exclusively a defense force and as
            justification, she emphasized that the word "defense" is the "D" in "IDF." A disappointing
            answer. Days later, I would learn that she herself is from a West Bank settlement called
            Adora, which was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Adora_terrorist_attack">attacked during the second intifada</a>.
            Four of her townspeople were killed when two attackers dressed as IDF soldiers, cut
            through the security fence and went house to house shooting children while families
            were praying for Shabbat. One of the dead was a young girl close in age to my Israeli
            companion. An attacker was later released as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit_prisoner_exchange">a trade for an IDF prisoner of war</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day02_hike_water_hole.jpg" style="float: left; width: 25%">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day02_hike.jpg" style="float: left; width: 25%">
            We started the day with a hike. Halfway through, we encountered a
            delightful pond that we went swimming in. Our wet clothes proved to be a good defense
            against the growing heat of the day. As we passed over diverse types of rocks,
            we learned that the Golan Heights was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights#Geology">formerly seismically active</a>.
            Consequently, mountains were formed that act as a watershed funneling
            clean rainwater into the Sea of Galilee, where it can be used for drinking and
            agriculture. This clarified why Israel is so determined to hold onto the Golan
            Heights; in a war, Syria could cut off roughly 10% of Israel's water supply, and
            indeed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headwater_Diversion_Plan_(Jordan_River)">Arab League</a>
            tried to do exactly that leading up to the Six Day War.

            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day02_rafting.jpg" style="float: left; width: 25%">
            Our final activity of the day was rafting. There was only one short section of the river
            that wasn't calm, but Becca, Dani, Nate and I entertained ourselves by chasing other
            rafts, throwing people out of their rafts (sorry Danny!) and attempting to paddle
            while facing in opposite directions.
        </p>

        <h2 style="clear: both;">Day 3 - Tzfat and the Kabbalah</h2>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day03_route.png" style="float: left; width: 15%">
            Day 3 started with a bus ride to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed">Tzfat</a>
            (also known as Safed), one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Holy_Cities">four holiest cities in Israel</a>,
            the others being Jerusalem,
            Hebron and Tiberias. Each of the four is considered for a different reason. Jerusalem is
            paramount for its selection by King David as the site of the Holy Temple. Hebron, the
            believed burial site of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs">Jewish Patriarchs</a>
            (Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and Leah) is secondary. Tiberias is significant for
            two reasons: first, Tiberias is the location where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud">Talmud</a>
            was first recorded from oral traditions; second, Tiberias

            Why Tiberias and Tzfat are
            considered holy escapes me, since neither seems to have hosted any significant spiritual
            event
        </p>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day03_kabbala.jpg" style="float: right; width: 35%">
            Our first stop was the <a href="https://www.kabbalahart.com/artist/">Tzfat Gallery of Mystical Art</a>,
            an art gallery run by a former American named Robert who made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah">Aliyah</a>
            (i.e. emigrated) to Israel and took the name Avraham Loewenthal. Apparently we were
            running behind schedule and there was another group after us, so he hurriedly attempted
            to explain to us the core concepts of the Kabbalah and how his art attempts to
            communicate those concepts visually. Before arriving, I asked one of the Israelis on
            the trip to explain what Kabbalah is and he said that the closest American concept is
            spiritual hippies, which I found apropos upon meeting Avraham. Kabbalah is an old
            interpretation of Judaism that took its modern form in the 16th century, when
            Sephardic Jews were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra_Decree">expelled from Spain </a>
            and relocated to Tzfat in Israel; their painful experiences led them to focus on
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_in_Judaism">Jewish Messiah</a>,
            a prophesied figure who would deliver the Jewish people from suffering.
        </p>

        <p>
            Avraham's explanation of core Kabbalah beliefs differs significantly from the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#Concepts">Wikipedia article</a>, so
            I'm not sure where exactly the truth lies. Avraham stated that Kabbalah holds that
            the world involves giving and taking, and that virtue stems from maximizing giving
            and minimizing taking. I asked whether his ideal world, in which everyone gives
            and no one takes, is necessarily contradictory. In response, he gave me a printout
            to read to resolve the apparent paradox, but the printout didn't seem relevant to the
            question. He also told us that Kabbalah believes in a sacred tie between
            a person and their name, and that adopting a new name when making Aliyah can feel like
            a transcendental moment. Many people in our group bought small copies of his art work.
        </p>

        <p style="clear: both">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day03_tzfat.jpg" style="float: left; width: 35%">
            After leaving Avraham's art store, we walked through the old Jewish quarter of Tzfat.
            Itamar shared with us the <a href="https://www.safed.co.il/war-of-independence-in-tzfat.html">story of how Israel came to control Tzfat</a>.
            As the British and French prepared to leave the Middle East, the UN Partition Plan
            for Palestine allocated for the Jewish people, but the city itself was home to 1700 Jews
            and 12000 Arabs. To make matters worse for the small Jewish population, they were
            poorly armed in comparison and lacked control over strategic areas of the city. However, the Jews
            were able to obtain an artillery weapon called the Davidka that was terribly inaccurate
            but frighteningly loud. Somehow, a rumor started amongst the Arabs that the Davidka was
            an atomic bomb and the Arabs fled from the city, ceding it to Jewish control.
        </p>

        <p style="clear: both">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day03_tzfat_professor.jpg" style="float: right; width: 35%">
            The group was given two hours to shop for souvenirs, so Dani,
            Nathan and I seized the opportunity to explore the city. We walked through streets
            that looks hundreds of years old, past citizens who looked equally dated, until
            we accidentally encountered the modern part of the city. It turns out the quarter
            we had been in was a small historical area and that the majority of the city
            does not live like that. One of the locals we met (right) laughed at us for thinking that
            the historical district is representative of the city. He also joked that I must be a
            professor since I asked so many questions.
        </p>


        <h2 style="clear: both;">Day 4 - Knesset Menorah, Israel Museum and the Western Wall</h2>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day04_route.png" style="float: right; width: 15%">
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day04_parliament_menorah.jpg" style="float: right; width: 35%">
            Day 4 started in Jerusalem at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset_Menorah">
            Knesset Menorah</a>, a 15 foot tall Menorah located near The Knesset (Israel's Parliament).
            I might not have been listening since it was only when I read the Wikipedia article that I
            learned that this menorah isn't some unimportant sculpture. It was a gift from the
            British Parliament and each branch portrays different stories of the Jewish people.
            The branches are not chronologically ordered, but are rather arranged
            to reflect thematic symmetry. The central branch displays the most important stories,
            including the 10 Commandments as given to Moses on Mount Sinai and Israel's War for
            Independence that create the state of Israel. I wasn't familiar with most of the
            stories on the menorah; the whole Wikipedia article is worth a read.
        </p>

        <p style="clear: both">
            We then visited the <a href="https://www.imj.org.il/en">Israel Museum of Jerusalem</a>.
            Several exhibits were interesting. The first was a 50:1 model replica of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple">Second Temple</a>, the holiest
            site in Judaism. Architecturally, the Temple is structured hierarchically and
            individuals were limited in where they could go based on their religious seniority.
            For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_the_women">outer forecourt</a>
            was open to all men, women and children, whereas only men were allowed to enter
            the Court of Israel and only (male) rabbis were permitted to enter the Court of the
            Priests. The highest place of the Temple, the Holy of Holies, was forbidden
            for all, except on Yom Kippur when the Chief Rabbi would enter with rope tied around
            his ankles, to be pulled out should anything happen to him. The Temple was destroyed
            during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70_CE)">a Jewish
            revolt against the Roman Empire</a>. One point that's unclear to me is whether the Jews
            were responsible for destroying the temple; evidence seems to suggest that Jews started
            a fire to ward off Romans that did the majority of the damage. This event is the
            motivation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av">Tisha B'Av</a>,
            an annual day of fasting to lament the loss of the First and Second Temples.
        </p>

            <img class="center" src="20190817/day04_model_temple.jpg" style="width: 100%">
        </p>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day04_astronaut.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%">
            Many people's favorite exhibit was the Dead Sea Scrolls, a set of religious
            manuscripts dated as early as 300 BCE, but I found the exhibit uninformative and
            uninspiring. The exhibit focused on where the scrolls were found, how the scrolls
            were preserved and what we know about the authors of the scrolls. My favorite exhibit
            concerned the Israeli astronaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Ramon">Ilan Ramon</a>,
            who was killed when Columbia exploded on re-entry. A secular Jew, Ramon
            flew to space with a number of moving personal objects including a pencil sketch titled "Moon
            Landscape" drawn by a 16-year old boy who died in Auschwitz and the US Declaration of
            Independence. The most powerful story concerned a miniature Torah scroll Ramon carried.
            Ramon was given the scroll by Joachim Yosef, a professor of astrophysics and climate
            science, who himself obtained the scrolls from the Rabbi who performed his Bar Mitzvah
            at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Shimon Dasberg; Dasberg gave Yosef the Torah
            scroll, fearing that he would not survive. Ramon asked Yosef for permission to take the
            scroll to space as a testament to the ability of the Jewish people to rise from the ashes
            and break the barriers of human capabilities. I thought of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>,
            one of the earliest astronauts to die in America's space program, who years before his
            death comforted our country by saying, "If we die, we want people to accept it. We are
            in a risky business and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the
            program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life." I imagine Ramon felt
            similarly.

            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day04_insta.jpg" style="float: left; width: 70%">
            At this point, we started looking a bit more like obnoxious American tourists...

            Our final stop of the day was the Western Wall. We were afforded the chance to leave
            a prayer at the Wall and many did. I repeatedly tried and failed to write a prayer that
            I wouldn't be ashamed of, until I remembered <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/Satan.html">
            a question Mark Twain once asked</a>. The prayer I left read "To the sinner that needs
            a prayer the most: I struggle to find the words to express how I feel, but I hope that

        <h2 style="clear: both;">Day 5 - Jerusalem, Ein Karem and B'nai Mitzvah</h2>

            Day 5 started in Jerusalem on Shabbat. We were given the whole morning off, so Dani,
            Nathan and I set out to explore the city. We were amazed at how quiet the city was.
            Not a shop was open, not a car moved, not a person was in the street other than
            Orthodox Jews walking in heavy black coats and wide black hats. As we walked through
            the street, we passed by a large white pop-up tent, almost like what I'd expect from
            a Midwest Evangelical traveling ministry. One Rabbi approached us and asked, in broken
            English, whether any of us were not Jewish. I figured since I was on Birthright I
            should say yes, so I did, but Dani said no and Nate followed her lead. The Rabbi then
            asked Nate if he could help with something; Nate disappeared behind the large white
            tent. While I waited, I had an awkward broken conversation with the remaining students.
            Eventually, Nate returned and we asked him what had happened. Apparently, there was
            some eletrical box used to control elements (lighting, curtains, etc.) of the prayer,
            but that the electrical box had broken and needed to be reset. The fix was trivial -
            press the reset button - but the Orthodox Jews were prohibited from using technology on
            Shabbat. He said that there were three or four grown men around the box, fretting how
            service might be impacted without a fix until he showed up to press the button.

            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day05_hebrew_uni_view.jpg" style="float: left; width: 35%">
            We continued on through a Muslim quarter of Jerusalem towards our goal of the Hebrew
            University of Jerusalem, which I wanted to see for its world-class Brain Sciences
            departments. As we walked through the Muslim quarter, we noticed a couple things. First,
            probably 1/4th of all shops were auto-repair shops; we tried asking locals why there
            were so many, but the only answers we received were "to repair cars." Second, local
            corner shops sold cleaning supplies in bottles that looked like common sugary
            beverages (imagine Arizona Ice Tea crossed with Gatorade), without any English
            text indicating that the fluid was not to be drunk. We eventually reached Hebrew
            University of Jerusalem (left), but unfortunately the entire campus appeared closed for
            Shabbat. By reading murals on campus, I learned that Hebrew University predates the
            state of Israel. It was formed in 1913 when the 11th Zionist Congress voted in favor of
            establishing a university for Jewish learning and construction started in 1918. During
            the 1948 War of Independence, the University was forced to relocate, but returned in
            1967.

            We then took a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gett">Gett taxi</a> (the Israeli
            equivalent of an Uber or Lyft) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Karem">Ein
            Karem</a> at the recommendation of one of our Israeli friends. I struck up a
            conversation with our driver and learned that he has lived in Jerusalem his entire life,
            working first as a driver for tourists going to the Dead Sea and then as a taxi driver
            in Jerusalem. He told us that what he loves most about Jerusalem is the natural beauty -
            he took us on a scenic route around the city, pointing out the surrounding hills.
            He suggested we start exploring Ein Karem at its mosque, promising us clean water
            to refill out canteens; we took him up on his suggestion only to discover the mosque
            appeared abandoned and its water labeled  "not for human consumption." The town was
            small, but modern. We stopped at an ice cream/gelato shop that was delicious.
            Nate swears that their date/pecan sorbet is some of the best ice cream he's ever had.
            We also discovered fried chicken on a family's rooftop, placed in a way that suggested
            they were using the sun and ambient heat to keep their chicken warm.

            We quickly learned that Ein Karem is a popular Christian pilgrimmage spot due to it
            being the birthplace of St. John the Baptist. An Israeli couple who were walking with
            us tried to strike up a conversation with the priest, but he didn't know how to speak
            English; thankfully, Nate was capable of translating from Spanish to English for the
            couple.

            After we returned to the hotel, our group spent the rest of the day chilling in a local
            park. One highlight was the group B'nai mitzvah

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day06_an_inch.jpg" style="float: left; width: 20%">
            <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/">Yad Vashem</a> is Israel's Holocaust Memorial.
            Photos aren't permitted inside, so I have very few. I'll share one photo that I snuck
            because the story touched me. As the picture reads, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Robota">Roza Robota</a>
            was interned at Auschwitz where she smuggled explosives to resistance fighters
            who used her explosives to destroy one of the crematoriums. While her courage was
            commendable, the reason her memory stayed with me was that when she was captured,
            she refused to name her co-conspirators, even under torture. As I
            stood in the memorial, I imagined that her story was the inspiration for Evey's
            torture scene in V for Vendetta, a scene in which a woman condemned to die in a concentration
            camp realizes that her integrity matters more to her than her life. I can't do the
            scene justice in words, but it's one of the most moving film scenes I've seen:

            Our final group activity before bed was a night hike to star gaze. Unfortunately,
            the moon was far too bright to see anything. Our guide used a nightlight to reveal
            that the landscape was dotted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathstalker">deathstalkers</a>,
            a species of scorpion that excels at camouflage and delivering a small dose of neurotoxins
            capable of killing humans. There was something mystical about being out in the desert,
            surrounded by silence, that enchanted Nate and I. We spoke with the camp's security
            guards and asked for permission to run to the top of the nearest ridge (maybe 4 miles
            away). They gave their blessing, so off we went. The run was one of my favorite parts
            of the trip. I can't describe why the run was so enrapturing. There's just something
            hypnotic about feeling the warm-but-simultaneously-relaxing desert night air with
            the stars twinkling above, running over ground illuminated by the moon as clear as day.
            As we nearest the crest of the ridge, we heard an Arabic song drifting over the hills,
            shared with the night by a local. We debated approaching their small camp, but decided
            to defer towards safety. In the photo below, the glow in the center is our Bedouin
            camp, and the lights to its left and right are other towns on the horizon.
