        <h1>Taglit-Birthright</h1>

        <p>
            I spent the past two weeks in traveling across Israel as part of
            <a href="https://www.birthrightisrael.com/about_us">Taglit Birthright Israel</a>
            on Bus 657 with approximately 40 American Jews and 10 Israeli Jews. As described
            on their website, "Birthright Israel aims to strengthen Jewish identity, Jewish
            communities, and connection with Israel and its people." The following is my
            recollection of the trip and its highlights.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1 - Afik Kibbutz Orchan and Shehecheyanu Ceremony</h2>

        <p>
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/itamar_bouton.jpg" align="left" width="20%">
            We were greeted at the airport by our Israeli participants and our Israeli guide,
            <a href="http://boutontour.com/">Itamar Bouton</a>, who would prove himself to
            be a capable, humorous leader over the course of the trip. He gave three
            simple rules to follow: don't be stupid, don't be a jerk, and don't be late!
        <p></p>

        <p>
            We immediately left Ben Gurion airport for
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afik">Afik</a>, an Israeli settlement in the
            Golan Heights, where we would spend the night at our first Kibbutz. Unbeknownst to me,
            Wikipedia mentions that the kibbutz is considered an illegal settlement under
            international law. I was unable to learn when the kibbutz was established, but the
            <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-golan-heights">Jewish Virtual Library</a>
            suggests that kibbutzim predated Israeli control of the Golan Heights, although no
            kibbutz was in Afik prior to Israel capturing the Golan Heights during the Six Day War.
        </p>

        <p>
            The kibbutz was lush and gorgeous. I was surprised to learn that the
            history of kibbutzim in Israeli is closely intertwined with Marxist/Communist elements;
            one of the pioneers wrote that "We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew
            more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was
            not the way we hoped to settle the countryâ€”this old way with Jews on top and Arabs
            working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed
            at all. There must be a better way." Decisions are made communally and (at least
            historically) resources and chores were shared. The captial necessary to purchase land
            came in the form of small donations from Jews across Europe.

        </p>

        <p>
            The final activity was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">Shehecheyanu</a>
            sundown, a Jewish prayer used to
            <img class="photo" src="20190817/day01_shehecheyanu.jpg" align="right" width="20%">
        </p>

        <h2>Day 2 - Hiking, Golan Heights and Rafting</h2>

        <p>
            As a constant reminder of the security challenges facing Israel, an 18-year old Israeli
            named Dvir Sorek was killed by two Palestinians, one who was a member of Hamas. Sorek was
            stabbed to death in his West Bank settlement of Migdal Oz, where he was a seminary and
            military student. His body was discovered the next morning and
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-nabs-the-two-suspected-killers-of-dvir-sorek-one-has-hamas-ties/">his killers were captured alive within three days</a>.
            <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-and-islamic-jihad-praise-heroic-west-bank-slaying-of-student/">Hamas claimed</a>
            that the attack was retaliation for Israeli destruction of Palestinian residential buildings
            in late July. Over breakfast, we asked one of the Israelis traveling with us for her
            perspective regarding Palestinians and the IDF, and one comment she made stuck with me:
            she claimed that the IDF is exclusively a defense force and as justification, she
            emphasized that the word "defense" is the "D" in "IDF." A disappointing answer. Days later,
            I would learn that she herself is from a West Bank settlement called Adora, which was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Adora_terrorist_attack">attacked during the second intifada</a>.
            Four of her townspeople were killed when two attackers dressed as IDF soldiers, cut
            through the security fence and went house to house shooting children while families
            were praying for Shabbat. One of the dead was a young girl close in age to my Israeli
            companion. An attacker was later released as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit_prisoner_exchange">a trade for an IDF prisoner of war</a>.
