- (This one was told to me by my research supervisor, who was told this joke herself during her PhD) 
If you really want to succeed in life, get a wife and a mistress. Then, when you really need to get your
work done, you can tell the mistress you’re with the wife and tell the wife you’re with the mistress.

- (Warning: Causal Inference Joke) One day at the airport, a very tiny, very petite grandmother is passing through security. As she steps up 
to the scanner, it reveals that her winter coat is filled with explosives! A security guard asks her to
step inside a private room and take off her coat. “Ma’am, you can’t fly like that!” the guard says. 
“What are you thinking??” The grandmother replies, “I read online that the probability of one bomb on a
flight is small, but that the probability of two bombs on a flight is even smaller!”

- (This was a true story told to me by my Resident Advisor at Harvard. She = my RA) She was a 7th year
PhD student and had been working on a paper for ~2.5 years. She and her supervisor finally submitted
the paper on a Friday. Her supervisor says to her, "Congratulations on finally finishing that paper!
You've been working so hard. I think you should treat yourself and take the weekend off." She replied
to her supervisor, "No - thank you for all your support! You've been so helpful. I think you should
treat yourself and take the weekend off." "Oh, I intend to!" her supervisor replied. On Monday, they 
reconvened to discuss new potential projects. My RA said to her supervisor, "Can I let you in on a 
little secret?" "Of course!" "I didn't really take the weekend off," she says. "Can I let you in 
a secret too?" her supervisor asks. "I didn't really take the weekend off either!"

## Start Ups
- We lose a little money on every customer, but we make it up on volume.

## Inappropriate

## Miscellaneous

- At a grocery store in Cambridge, there's a 10 item or less express checkout lane. One day, a student
shows up with over fifty items and starts checking out. A line forms behind the student, and the 
other customers start to grumble, so a store clerk comes over to talk to the student. "Excuse me,
this is the express lane." "I know that," the student snaps. The clerk snaps back, "Then are you
a Harvard student who can't count, or an MIT student who can't read?"
