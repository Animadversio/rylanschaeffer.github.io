#### 2016
- [UC Davis College of Engineering Commencement Student Speaker](talks/coe_commencement_speech.mp4)
The talk was inspired by Professor [Phillip Rogaway's](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/)
[paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0580/cb6c869de3b3311a4b5616c6e696755be7bc.pdf)
that I had a chance to comment on in his graduate seminar, Professor [Norm Matloff's](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html)
boundless patience for discussing student engagement, pedagogical theory and really anything with me, and Professor
[Matt Bishop's](http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/) love of science fiction that reignited my
interest in dreaming of possible worlds. Sadly, the previous speaker's talk on how much money the graduating
engineers were about to make was much better received.
