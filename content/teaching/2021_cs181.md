### Mid-semester Feedback (Mandatory)

- Rylan's fantastic!
- [TA 1], Rylan, and [TA2 ] are wonderful and provide great advice for the problems! 
  Rylan is especially clear in his explanations. I wish [TA 3] and [TA 4] were a bit 
  more clear with their explanations.
- Rylan is an excellent TF.  I really appreciate how he takes the time to slow down 
  and break things down.
- [TA 5] is great. Rylan needs to move 3x as fast (he doesnâ€™t get through almost all 
  of the material). He also answered questions really long-windedly.
- Rylan needs to speed up! He has so many digressions.
- I feel included and encouraged to participate in the vast majority of office hours
  (95%), but I have a vivid memory of one office hours before the midterm (I believe 
  it was Rylan's) where some students were more assertive and constantly kept asking 
  questions, and I didn't feel like there was space for me to ask a question I had 
  about one of the midterm practice problems. I acknowledge that I should have raised 
  my digital hand or did something to get Rylan's attention, and for prior questions 
  Rylan did go around and name everyone who wasn't speaking to see if they had questions, 
  but I still struggled to make space for myself. I'm not sure if Rylan could have 
  done very much in that situation given the students were very quick to ask more 
  questions, but that was a less-than-ideal office hours experience of mine that I
  thought I'd share.
- Nothing. Absolutely want to emphasize Rylan is doing a terrific job for us.
- I really appreciate Rylan's teaching. Nothing else to say, just passionate, 
  engaging, and clear. Perfect.
- I attended Rylan's office hours once (although this was early in the semester 
  so of course things might have improved since then). However, I found myself 
  more confused than before I came. I think it would be great if Rylan spent 
  more time checking in with students when explaining or, instead of jumping straight
  into a conceptual overview of the entire topic, it might be useful to ask the 
  student questions to see what they understand and what their difficulties/misunderstandings
  are.
- Rylan is a very clear explainer and I've learned a lot from hearing him discuss
  concepts from first principles, but he sometimes elaborates too much on the 
  details, and I find that this can distract from the core concepts at hand. 
  I'd recommend trying to focus on getting across one main concept at a time.
- Rylan works through the problems with us, if anything the method is more
  important than the answer a it can be generalized and applied to more questions!
- Rylan's walkthroughs are super helpful! I think group discussions are 
  a more effective use of office hours time instead of only having one on 
  one questions. I think it would be great if one TF would answer one-on-one 
  questions while the second TF does group discussions.
- Rylan is amazing!
