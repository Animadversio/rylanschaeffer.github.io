# UC Davis ECS 98 Spring 2015
## History of Computer Science

I designed and taught my second course, a 1-unit lower division seminar in Spring 2015, on the History of Computer Science. In case you're interested in learning more about it, here is the updated <a href="../articles/HistoryofCSSyllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>. I want to thank <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/lecturers/index.html">Sean Davis</a> for serving as my instructor of record, as well as Nina Amenta, Phillip Rogaway, Matthew Farrens, Norm Matloff, Vladimir Filkov, Patrice Koehl and Lori Avellar for making the seminar possible.


The two main books I used were <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15937797-computer">Computer: A History of the Information Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299652.The_Universal_Computer">The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing</a>. I also enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493321-logicomix">Logicomix: An epic search for truth</a> while searching for course material.

Eleven of 15 students submitted course evaluations, and nine submitted the extended course evaluation. You can read their <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QGgtASCoJYZCxTJaJYoL02156iRUl2Ri_fB8Few-pnE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics">responses</a>. The evaluations were handwritten, so I digitized the students' responses. Some handwriting was illegible, so some information was lost.
