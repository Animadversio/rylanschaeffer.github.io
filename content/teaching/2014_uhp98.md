# UC Davis UHP 98 Spring 2014
## Davis Hacks


The first course I taught was a 1-unit seminar for University Honors Program students on how to maximize one's undergraduate educational experience. I co-taught with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjsheehan">Patrick Sheehan</a>. The course was based on a previous course we both took taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rajiv-narayan/18/b0b/72a">Rajiv Narayan</a>. I may post the material at some later date, but for those interested in the key lessons, read <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/about/">Cal Newport's Blog</a>.
