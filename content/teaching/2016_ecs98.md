# UC Davis ECS 98 Spring 2016
## Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies

I designed and taught my third class, a 2-unit upper division course titled <a href="../files/198FCourseSyllabus.pdf">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> in Spring 2016 under the supervision of <a href="http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/levitt/">Karl Levitt</a>. I co-taught with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinyang">Vincent Yang</a>. The first half of our course is based on Princeton's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/bitcointech">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> course. Lecture notes (some incomplete) and their corresponding .tex files are available <a href="https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ECS198-Cryptocurrency-Technologies/tree/master/Lectures">online</a>.


The term project specifications can be viewed <a href="../files/198FTermProject.pdf"> here</a>. Towards the end, the project morphed from "What new system would you create?" to "Present an existing system or propose a modification of an existing system." In retrospect, that should have been the project from the beginning. The projects are publicly available <a href="https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ECS198-Cryptocurrency-Technologies/tree/master/Projects">here</a>; I was most impressed by Team 2.

Nine of 23 students submitted <a href="../files/RylanECS198F.pdf">evaluations</a>. The first three questions are on a five-point scale, and the remaining questions are on a ten-point scale. Before the course began, students with little programming experience asked to add a 1-unit version of the class to learn the conceptual material; we agreed. Looking back, this was a mistake. It increased our workload, which precluded us from developing more thoughtful assignments. We also had to teach to two very different audiences, which I think was best captured in a student's following comment: "I had no idea what hashing was and never constructed a tree before. I couldn't understand how those concepts played a major role in Bitcoin. Similarly, I felt lost throughout most lectures. I'm not sure if it's because of my insufficient background, or me just not taking good enough notes." Given another opportunity, I would have been adhered to the course's prerequisites I initially set.
