        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          Grid cells are neurons that fire if and only if an animal is physically located at a
          vertex of a triangular lattice tiling the 2D environment. This produces a triangular/hexagonal
          pattern of neural activity as the animal navigates through the environment. Grid cells are
          identified by three parameters: the spacing of the lattice, the orientation of the lattice
          relative to some reference axis and a translational offset. Sub-networks of grid cells,
          called modules, fire with the same lattice period and the same orientation, but with a
          2D translational offset. By cleverly combining multiple modules, animals can create a
          unique code for identifying their location in a 2D environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <img class="photo" src="stretch_birds_1.png" style="float: left; width: 35%">
          Evidence also suggests that grid cells can be used to represent conceptual task variables
          in 2 dimensions. In one <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6292/1464.long">study</a>,
          experimenters trained participants to map cartoon pictures of birds to cartoon Christmas images.
        <p>

          <img class="photo" src="stretch_birds_2.png" style="float: right; width: 20%">
          But unbeknown by the participants, the birds were constructed by varying the length of
          their necks and the length of their legs in a manner that implicitly defined a
          two-dimensional task space (right), where the task could be thought of as identifying the
          "location" of the Christmas images based on the (neck length, leg length) position.
          Surprisingly, evidence suggested that grid cells were used to solve this task.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, many tasks might reasonably require higher dimensional spaces for representation and
          computation. Some researchers have looked into 3D grid cells for animals that navigate
          vertically (e.g. bats), but a strong, positive answer hasn't emerged, and there's certainly
          no indication of grid cells for dimensions ($n \geq 4$).
          <img class="photo" src="naive_coding.png" style="float: left; width: 20%">
          To clarify why this is problematic, imagine how one might represent $\mathbb{R}^3$ in
          $\mathbb{R}^2$. If we naively try projecting $\mathbb{R}^3$ down to $\mathbb{R}^2$ (left),
          the mapping will be non-invertible (since one dimension will be lost) and the animal
          will be unable to unambiguously identify where it is located. In the cartoon depiction,
          the animal can identify its $(x, y)$ position, but its $z$ position is ambiguous.

        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <p>
          This raised a conundrum: how does the neural circuitry that underpins $\mathbb{R}^2$
          work in arbitrary $\mathbb{R}^N$ while its activity is constrained to $\mathbb{R}^2$?
          More specifically, we might ask the following questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Could the same neural circuitry used for representing 2-D Euclidean space also
            be used for representing N-dimensional Euclidean space?</li>
          <li>How could we characterize the capacity of such a representation?</li>
          <li>What parameters determine the capacity, and how does the capacity scale as a function
            of those parameters?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Intuition</h2>
        <p>
          The answer is yes, the same neural circuitry can be used
        </p>

        <h2>Mathematics</h2>

        <p>
          We first need to start by understanding a commonly used model of grid cell modules
          in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This model posits that each grid cell module converts the animal's
          position $x(t)$ into a macroscopic 2D periodic variable $\phi(x(t))$, where the change in firing
          $\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ is related to the animal's change in position $\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$ by
          a linear velocity operator.
        </p>

        <p>
          $
          \begin{align}
          \frac{d\phi}{dt} &= A \frac{dx(t)}{dt}
          \end{align}
          $
        </p>

        <p>
          A module might have some default $\varphi$
        </p>
