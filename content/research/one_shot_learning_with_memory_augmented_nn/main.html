          I've found that the overwhelming majority of online information on artificial intelligence research falls into one of two categories: the first is aimed at explaining advances to lay audiences, and the second is aimed at explaining advances to other researchers. I haven't found a good resource for people with a technical background who are unfamiliar with the more advanced concepts and are looking for someone to fill them in. This is my attempt to bridge that gap, by providing approachable yet (relatively) detailed explanations. In this post, I explain the titular paper - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065">One-shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks</a>.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          One-shot learning,

        </p><br>

        <p>
          I suppose that I should warn readers: this post has a substantial background section that might not be entirely necessary, but that I feel provides the larger context absent from the paper.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        

        <p>
          LSTMS have problems. Graves et al. created Neural Turing Machine to give a recurrent neural network an explicit memory. Memory was structured in a way that reading and writing would be differentiable, and thus learnable. Inspired by neuroscience to some degree. Working memory different from episodic memory.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          LSTMs were suggested in a subsequent paper (2001) of being a promising approach towards solving meta-learning. This paper modifies Neural Turing Machines to improve on LSTM results with respect to one-shot learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Intuition</h2>

        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        
        <h2>Experiments and Results</h2>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Two key challenges for connectionist approaches to AI are </li>
            <li>RNNs can solve the first. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
