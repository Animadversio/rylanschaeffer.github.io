The paradox of choice | Barry Schwartz

Freedom is morally good, accomplished through offering choice

patient autonomy, supermarket choices, gender, marriage, career, cell phone/email/notifications

two negative effects:
	1. paralysis: difficult to choose
		study: investments in voluntary retirement funds
			participation declines for more options
	2. less satisfied with choice because
		a. easy to imagine opportunity cost -> regret
		b. escalation of expectations
		c. self-blame because you made poor choice

Secret to happiness: low expectations
