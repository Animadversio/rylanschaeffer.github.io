        <div>

          <p>
            Consider trying to solve a generic linear, first-order differential equation:

            $$ a(x) y'(x) + b(x) y(x) = h(x)$$

          </p>

          <h3 id="linear_first_order_integrating_factor">Solution 1: Integrating Factor</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              If $a(x) \neq 0$, one way we can find the solution $y(x)$ is
              is by using a function $f(x)$ called an integrating factor. To see
              where the idea arises, let's divide both sides by $a(x)$. For brevity, I
              drop $x$.

              $$y' + \frac{b}{a} y = \frac{h}{a}$$

              Suppose there exists a function $f(x)$ such that $\frac{1}{f}(fy)' = y' + \frac{b}{a} y$.
              If we could find such a function, we could use it to solve the differential
              equation:

              \begin{align*}
              y' + \frac{b}{a} y &= \frac{h}{a}\\
              \frac{1}{f}(fy)' &= \\
              f y - f(x_0)y(x_0) &= \int_{t=x_0}^t \frac{h(t) f(t)}{a(t)} \, dt\\
              y  &= \frac{f(x_0)}{f(x)} y(x_0) + \frac{1}{f(x)} \int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{h(t) f(t)}{a(t)} \, dt\\
              \end{align*}

              The key insight was to express the inconvenient $y' + \frac{b}{a} y$ as a
              derivative $(fy)'$ that we could easily integrate. The question is now how to find $f(x)$.
              We start by setting $\frac{1}{f}(fy)' = y' + \frac{b}{a} y$ and then solve for $f(x)$:

              \begin{align*}
              \frac{1}{f}(fy)' &= y' + \frac{b}{a} y\\
              \frac{1}{f}(f' y + y f') &= y' + \frac{b}{a} y\\
              \frac{f'}{f} &= \frac{b}{a}\\
              \log f(x) - \log f(x_0) &= \int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{b(t)}{a(t)} \, dt\\
              f(x) &= f(x_0) \exp \Big(\int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{b(t)}{a(t)} \, dt \Big)
              \end{align*}

            </p>

            <p>
              When we plug $f(x)$ back into our equation for $y(x)$, we see that the initial
              condition $f(x_0)$ doesn't matter because it cancels out:

              \begin{align*}
              y  &= \frac{f(x_0)}{f(x)} y(x_0) + \frac{1}{f(x)} \int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{h(t) f(t)}{a(t)} \, dt\\
              &= \exp \Big(-\int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{b}{a} \, dt \Big) y(x_0) + \frac{1}{f(x_0)} \exp \Big(-\int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{b}{a} \, dt \Big) \int_{t=x_0}^x \frac{h(t) f(t)}{a(t)} \, dt
              \end{align*}

            <p>
              Define the linear operator $l(y) = a(x) y'(x) + b(x) y(x)$. Suppose that
              $y_n \in \ker (l)$; that is, $l(y_n)$ = 0; we'll call $y_n$ the null or homogeneous
              solution. Then given a single $y_p$ which solves $l(y_p) = h(x)$, we can write any
              solution $y(x)$ as $y_p + C y_n$ for some suitable $C$. To see why, consider
              $l(y - y_p)$. Since $l$ is a linear operator, $l(y - y_p) = l(y) - l(y_p) = h(x) - h(x)
              = 0$. This implies that $y - y_p \in \ker(l) \Rightarrow \exists C$ s.t.
              $y - y_p = C y_n \Rightarrow y = y_p + C y_n$.
            </p>

          <h3>No Source Term</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Consider the following linear, first-order differential equation where
              $y'(t)$ is shorthand for $\frac{dy(t)}{dt}$:

              $$y'(t) = a y(t) $$

              The solution to this differential equations is one of the most important functions,
              the exponential function. To see that the exponential function is the correct solution to the above
              differential equation, observe that:

              $$y(t) = y(0) e^{a t} \Rightarrow y'(t) = a \, y(0) e^{a t} = a y(t) $$

              Intuitively, what this means is that a system with these dynamics will either grow
              exponentially (for $a > 0$) or decay exponentially (for $a < 0$). For $a=0$, the
              system will sit unchanged.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Source Term</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Now, suppose a source term $q(t)$ is added:

              $$y'(t) = a y(t) + q(t)$$

              Every equation like this will have two solutions: the null solution and the
              particular solution. By null solution, I mean the solution $y_n(t)$ to the equation:

              $$ y_n'(t) - a y_n(t) = 0$$

              By particular solution, I mean the solution $y_p(t)$ to the equation:

              $$ y_p'(t) - a y_p(t) = q(t)$$

              The complete solution $y_c = y_p + y_n$ to this ODE is the sum of the null solution and the
              particular solution:

              $$
              \begin{align*}
              0 &= y_n'(t) - a y_n(t)\\
              q(t) &= y_p'(t) - a y_p(t)\\
              0 + q(t) &= y_n'(t) - a y_n(t) + y_p'(t) - a y_p(t)\\
              q(t) &= (y_n'(t) + y_p'(t)) - a(y_n(t) + y_p(t))\\
              &= y_c'(t) - a y_c(t)
              \end{align*}
              $$

              We should think of the null solution as the behavior of the system with no external source
              and the particular solution as the behavior of the system for the exact choice of external
              source $q(t)$.
            </p>

            <p>
              A general solution to the equation $y'(t) - a y(t) = q(t)$ is the following:

              $$y(t) = y(0)e^{at} + \int_0^t e^{a(t-s)} q(s) ds $$

              Before deriving this, let's try to gain some intuition for it. We see that
              if the source term is zero i.e. $q(t) = 0$, we recover the solution to the sourceless
              differential equation i.e. $y(t) = y(0)e^{at}$. As we expect, the starting condition $y(0)$
              grows (decays) exponentially depending on whether $a > 0$ ($a < 0$). The second term
              is like a continuous sum of the new inputs, but each input $q(s)$ also grows/decays
              exponentially depending on how much time has elapsed since its occurence. For instance,
              if we're at $t=4$ and there was an input at time $t=2$, $q(s=2)$ , we would expect that
              input to have grown/decayed proportional to the elapsed two seconds i.e. $q(s=2) e^{a(4-2)}$.
              To derive this equation,
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Solutions to Common Source Terms</h3>
          <div>

            <h4>Constant Source $q(t) = q$</h4>
            <p>
              Using the above equation, we can derive response functions to several commonly encountered
              source functions. First, let's consider a constant source i.e. $q(t) = q$:

              $$
              \begin{align*}
              y(t) &= y(0) e^{at} + \int_0^t e^{a(t-s)} q ds\\
              &= y(0) e^{at} + q e^{at} \int_0^t e^{-as} ds\\
              &= y(0) e^{at} + q e^{at} \frac{-1}{a} e^{-as} \Bigr\rvert_{s=0}^{s=t}\\
              &= y(0) e^{at} + \frac{q}{a}(e^{at} - 1) & \text{Response to constant source}
              \end{align*}
              $$

              What happens here? As we might expect,
            </p>

          <h3>Delta Function</h3>
          <div>
            The delta function can be represented in different ways that are useful in specific
            contexts. Some of these forms are:

            <ul>
              <li>Gaussian: $\delta(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \epsilon}}
                e^{-x^2 / 2 \epsilon^2}$</li>
              <li>Lorentzian: $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\pi \epsilon} \frac{1}{1 + x^2/\epsilon^2}$</li>
              <li>Fourier: $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{sin(x/\epsilon)}{x \pi} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{ixt} dt$</li>

        <h3>Solving Linear, First-Order ODEs with Integrating Factors</h3>
        <div>

          <p>
            $u(x_0)$ doesn't matter since the final form of $y(x)$ is multiplied
            by $u(s)$ and divided by $u(x)$, so such a coefficient would cancel. This shows that
            any linear first-order ODE can be solved using such an integrating factor:

            $$ u(x) = \exp (\int_{x_0}^x \frac{b(s)}{a(s)} ds)$$
          </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Linear Stability Analysis</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            For a continuous time dynamical system, we might want to understand whether, and how
            quickly, a point near a stable fixed point flows to the fixed point. Concretely, let
            $x$ be the phase space of some system and let $x^*$ be a fixed point of the system.
            We can define a small perturbation away from the fixed point as $\eta(t) \defeq x(t) - x^*$.
            Note that this is equivalent to defining a time-varying variable $x(t) = x^* + \eta(t)$.
            We'd like to understand whether this small pertubation, $\eta(t)$ grows or decays over
            time, and to answer such a question, we can construct a differential equation to describe
            the behavior of $\eta(t)$.
          </p>

          <p>
            $\begin{align}
            \frac{d}{dt}\eta(t) &= \frac{d}{dt} (x(t) - x^*)\\
            &= \frac{d}{dt} x(t)\\
            \end{align}$
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the definition of $x(t) = x^* + \eta(t)$, we can construct a Taylor Series
            expansion of $\frac{d}{dt} x(t)$ at $x^*$:
          </p>

          <p>
            $\begin{align}
            \frac{d}{dt} x(t) &= \frac{d}{dt} (x^* + \eta (t))\\
            &\approx \frac{d}{dt} x^* + \eta(t) \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x^* + O(\eta^2)\\
            \end{align}$
          </p>

          <p>
            Since $x^*$ is a fixed point, $\frac{d}{dt} x^* = 0$ and thus:
          </p>

          <p>
            $\begin{align}
            \frac{d}{dt}\eta(t) = \eta(t) \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x^*
            \end{align}$
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a linear equation in $\eta$ and is therefore called the "linearization about
            $x^*$". If $\frac{d^2}{dt^2} x^*$ is also zero, the $O(\eta^2)$ term that we previously
            ignored will become relevant. This linearization tells us that if the second derivative
            at $x^*$ is negative, then the perturbation will shrink, and inversely, if the
            second derivative is positive, the perturbation will grow larger. The absolute value
            of the second derivative, $|d^2 x^* / dt^2|$ tells us how quickly the pertubation will grow/shrink
            and its reciprocal $\frac{1}{|d^2 x^* / dt^2|}$ is called the <b>characteristic time scale</b>
            which expresses how much time is required to modify $x$ by a fixed amount around $x^*$.
