# Hilbert Space

A Hilbert space is an [inner product space](inner_product.md) 
containing limits of Cauchy Sequences.

Infinite sequences: the space $$l_2$$ (square summable sequences) comprises all
sequences $$a = (a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$$ for which

$$ ||a||_{l_2}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i^2 < \infty$$
