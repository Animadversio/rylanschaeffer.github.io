# Hilbert Space

A Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$ is an [inner product space](inner_product.md) that is

**separable**, meaning

-**complete**, meaning that the limits of all Cauchy Sequences are also in $$\mathcal{H}$$.

Infinite sequences: the space $$l_2$$ (square summable sequences) comprises all
sequences $$a = (a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$$ for which

$$ ||a||_{l_2}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i^2 < \infty$$


All elements of a Hilbert space are linear functionals in that space.

$$f_z(x) := \langle x, z \rangle$$
