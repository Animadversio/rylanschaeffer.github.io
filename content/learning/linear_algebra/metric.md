## Metric Vector Space

A __metric vector space__ is a vector space equipped with a metric. Frequently, if we
are dealing with a [normed vector space](norm.md#normed-vector-space)
(i.e. a vector space equipped with a nrom), we can define a metric as the
norm of the difference of two elements in the vector space:

$$d(v_1, v_2) \defeq \lvert \lvert x \lvert \lvert_2 $$
