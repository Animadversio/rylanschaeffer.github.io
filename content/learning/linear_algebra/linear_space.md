# Linear Space

A linear space is a set $$X$$ with an associated scalar field $$\mathbb{F}$$ (typically the
reals or complex) that has the two following operations:

1. Vector addition: $$X \times X \rightarrow X$$

2. Scalar multiplication: $$X \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow X$$

which satisfy the following properties:
