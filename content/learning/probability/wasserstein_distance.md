# Wasserstein Distance

The Wasserstein distance is a way of quantifying the distance between probability distributions
on a metric space. Suppose $$P(x), Q(x)$$ are two cumulative distributions functions of the
real random variable $$X$$. The Wasserstein metric is defined as

$$W_p(P,Q) = \Big(\int_0^1 du \lvert P^{-1}(u) - Q^{-1}(u)\lvert^p \Big)^{1/p}$$
