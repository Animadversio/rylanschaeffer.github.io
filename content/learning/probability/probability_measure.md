# Probability Measures

__Parent__: [Probability](../probability.md)

A __measure__ is a function that maps a set to a non-negative real in a countably
additive manner. A function $$P: X \rightarrow [0, 1]$$ is called a __probability
measure on $$X$$__ if

1. $$P$$ is normalized i.e. $$P(X) = 1$$
   
2. $$P$$ is $$\sigma$$-additive i.e. P(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} c_i) =
   \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(c_i)$$
