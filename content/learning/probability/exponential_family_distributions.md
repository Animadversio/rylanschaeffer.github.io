# Exponential Family Distributions

Many parametric distributions can be written in a similar form. This family of distributions
is called the exponential family and has the form

$$p(x, \theta) = \frac{1}{Z(\theta)} h(x) \exp(\eta(\theta)^T T(x))$$

where $$\eta(\theta)$$ are the natural parameters, $$T(x)$$ are the sufficient statistics
and $$Z(\theta)$$ is a normalization constant.
