# Matrix Normal Distribution

The matrix Normal distribution defines a Gaussian-like distribution
over a $$\mathcal{MN}$$


## Alternative Proposed Definition

[In 2018, Shane Barratt proposed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11010.pdf) an alternative definition
of the Matrix Normal distribution based on the correct observation that for the previous definition,
the covariance could have up to $$(np)^2$$ degrees of freedom but instead has only $$n^2 + p^2$$,
leaving the model
