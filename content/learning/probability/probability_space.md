# Probability Spaces

__Parent__: [Probability](../probability.md)

## Definition

A probability space is a 3-tuple consisting of

1. A set $$\Omega$$ called the sample space i.e. the set of all possible outcomes
2. A [$$\sigma$$-algebra](sigma_algebra.md) $$F$$ on the set $$\Omega$$, which informally specifies
   the set of all "possible" events (events are outcomes or combinations of outcomes)
3. A [probability measure](probability_measure.md) $$P: F \rightarrow [0, 1]$$

A __measurable space__ (also called a Borel space) is a 2-tuple consisting of

1. A set $$X$$
2. A A [$$\sigma$$-algebra](sigma_algebra.md) on the set $$X$$

When the 2-tuple measure space is equipped with a measure $$\mu$$, becoming a 3-tuple,
the measurable space becomes a __measure space__.
