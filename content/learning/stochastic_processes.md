# Stochastic Processes

A stochastic process is a set of random variables indexed by some other set. For instance,
a sequence of stock prices $$\{ X_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq T }$$ is a stochastic process where the
index set is time $$t \in [0, T]$$. One interpretation is therefore that stochastic processes are
distributions over function spaces.
