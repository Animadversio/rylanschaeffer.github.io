# Stochastic Processes

A stochastic process is a set of random variables indexed by some other set. For instance,
a sequence of stock prices $$\{ X_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq T }$$ is a stochastic process where the
index set is time $$t \in [0, T]$$.

## Dirichlet Process

A Dirichlet process is intimately connected with several others, including the 
_stick breaking process_, the _Chinese restaurant process_ and the _Polya urn scheme_.
