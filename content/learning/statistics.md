## Estimators

An estimator is a rule for calculating some estimate on a desired quantity
using data. The rule is the __estimator__, the quantity of interest is the
__estimand__ and the result of applying the rule to data is the __estimate__.

### Properties

Let $\hat{\theta}(\dot)$ be an estimator and $\theta$ the estimand. We
define the following properties for the estimator:

1. __Bias__: $B(\hat{\theta}) = \mathcal{E}_{p(x)}[\hat{\theta}(x)] - \theta$
