            <p>
              Consider the following system with $A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\
              a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{C}^2$:

              $$\dot{x} = A x $$

              If we consider the characteristic polynomial of $A$, we see that $A$ has two eigenvalues
              $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ which depend on $\tau \defeq \Tr(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$ and
              $\Delta \defeq \det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2$:

              \begin{align*}
              \det(A - \lambda I) &= \lambda^2 + - (a_{11} + a_{22})\lambda + (a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21})\\
              &= \lambda^2 - \tau \lambda + \Delta
              \end{align*}

              Consequently:

              $$\lambda = \tau \pm \frac{\sqrt{\tau^2 - 4 \Delta}}{2} $$

        <h2 id="nonlinear_stability_definitions">Non-Linear Stability Definitions</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            For non-linear systems, multiple notions of stability exist. The first notion of
            stability is an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$, defined as a point in the phase space
            with all derivatives equal to 0. However, equilibrium points aren't the only focus.
            We also care about the behavior of the system in general. Consequently, we have
            a sequence of definitions of stability.
          </p>

          <p>
            We say that an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$ is <b>stable</b> a point that starts within
            a small ball (defined by radius $r$) around the equilibrium point can be bounded in how
            far it can move away from the point. Intuitively, this means that the the system is
            guaranteed to remain "close" to the equilibrium point if it starts close to the point.
            Formally, we write:

            $$ \forall R > 0, \exists 0 < r < R \text{ s.t. } ||x(0) - x_{eq}|| < r \Rightarrow ||x(t) - x_{eq}|| < R$$
          </p>

          <p>
            We say that an equilibrium point is <b>asymptotically stable</b> if it is stable and
            if starting near the point guarantees that the system will converge back to the
            equilibrium point. Formally, we write:

            $$\exists r_0 > 0 \text{ s. t. } ||x(0) - x_{eq}|| < r_0 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \to \infty}||x(t) - x_{eq} ||
            \rightarrow 0 $$
          </p>

          <p>
            We say that an equilibrium point is <b>global asymptotically stable</b> if that initial radius
            $r_0 = \infty$. In this case, we say that the system (not just the point!) is globally
            asymptotically stable because we know that there can only be one equilibrium point. If there
            was another, then starting at the second equilibrium point wouldn't converge to the first
            equilibrium point, contradicting the claim that the point is globally asymptocally stable.
          </p>

          <p>
            We say that an equilibrium point is <b>exponentially stable</b> if starting near the
            equilibrium point ensures that (potentially after some elapsed time) the system
            converges exponentially fast to the fixed point. Formally, we write that

            $$\exists \delta > 0, \exists \alpha > 1, \exists \lambda > 0 \text{ s.t. } ||x(t) - x_{eq}|| <
            \delta \Rightarrow \forall t\geq 0,  ||x(t) - x_{eq} || \leq \alpha || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda t}$$

            One cool point is that if we write $\alpha$, which is just a positive value, as $e^{\lambda \tau}$,
            we see that the bound of $\alpha || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda t}$ can be rewritten as
            $ || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda (t - \tau)}$. This shows that $\alpha$ can
            be viewed as a time delay: the state will converge exponentially fast starting from $\tau_0$.
            We say that an equilibrium point is <b>globally exponentially stable</b> if $r_0 = \infty$.
            Similar to global asymptotic stability, we can describe both the equilibrium point and the
            system entirely as globally exponentially stable since only one equilibrium point can
            exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that exponential stability implies stability. To see this, suppose that a
            point $x_{eq}$ that is exponentially stable. For any bounding radius $R$, we can
            always find a corresponding $r < R$ to ensure that. Define $r = \min \{\frac{R}{\alpha}, \delta \}$
            and assume that $||x(0)|| < r$.

            \begin{align*}
            ||x(t) - x_{eq}||
            &\leq \alpha ||x(0) - x_{eq} ||e^{-\lambda t} & \text{Defn. of exponential stability and } ||x(0|| < \delta\\
            &\leq \alpha ||x(0) - x_{eq} || & e^{-\lambda t} \text{ is monotonically decreasing for increasing } t \geq 0\\
            &< \alpha r & \text{By assumption, } ||x(0)|| < r\\
            &< \alpha \frac{R}{\alpha} & \text{Holds regardless of whether } r = \frac{R}{\alpha} \text{ or } r = d\\
            &< R
            \end{align*}

            Thus we conclude that exponential stability implies stability.

        <h2 id="linearization_and_local_stability">Linearization and Local Stability</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Linearization around a fixed point is a method for studying the type of stability
            the fixed point has. The idea is to Taylor-series expand about the equilibrium
            point to first order and disregard higher order terms (HOT). Suppose our system is
            $\dot{x} = f(x)$. Then linearizing about a fixed point
            $x_{eq} = 0$ (if the fixed point isn't at $0$, perform a coordinate transform) yields

            $$f(x) = f(0, 0) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0, u=0} x + \text{ H.O.T.}$$

            Since $f(0) = 0$ due to being a fixed point,

            $$\dot{x} = f(x) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0,\\u=0} x + \text{ H.O.T.}$$

            If we drop the higher order terms, we call the simplified system the <b>linearization</b>
            or <b>linear approximation</b> of the system.

            $$ \dot{x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0,\\u=0} x$$

            The matrix $A \defeq \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0, u=0}$ has a name: the Jacobian.
            This leads us to Lypaunov's Linearization Method, which states:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Theorem:</b> Let $\dot{x} = Ax$ be the linearization of some dynamical system.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If all eigenvalues of the Jacobian are in the left half of the complex plane
                (i.e. the linearized system is strictly stable),
                then the equilibrium point in the original dynamical system is asymptotically stable.
              </li>
              <li>
                If at least one eigenvalue of the Jacobian is in the right half of the complex plane
                (i.e. the linearized system is unstable), then the equilibrium point in the
                original dynamical system is unstable.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are in the left half of the complex plane or
                on the vertical axis (i.e. the linearized system is marginally stable), then
                no conclusion can be drawn about the equilibrium point in the original dynamical system.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Proof:</b> TODO
          </p>

          <p>
            To understand the third possible outcome of the theorem, compare the systems $\dot{v} + |v|v = 0$ and $\dot{v} - |v|v = 0$.
            Both systems' linearizations are $\dot{v}=0$, but the first system is asymptotically stable around
            $v=0$ while the other system is unstable around $v=0$. The reason is that the higher order terms
            we disregarded when linearizing the system contained the information necessary to make
            this determination. For another simple example, consider $\dot{x} = ax + x^5$ with corresponding
            linearization $\dot{x} = ax$. Clearly, if $a < 0$, the system converges, and if $a > 0$, the system
            diverges, but we can't say anything for $a = 0$.

        <h2 id="lyapunov_direct_method">Lyapunov's Direct Method</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Linearization is a useful technique in the local vicinity of a fixed point, but it isn't sufficient.
            We'd like to be able to describe the behavior of the system in
            general, even when far away from fixed points. One insight from physics is that for
            a system with dissipating energy, the system must eventually settle down to a fixed point.
            Professor Slotine used the example of a pendulum; if $\theta$ is the angle away from the
            pendulum hanging straight down, both $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$ are fixed points. What
            differentiates them, though, is that the pendulum hanging straight down has no energy,
            meaning it is stable, whereas the pendulum upright has potential energy; if
            the pendulum is perturbed away from the upright position, and if the pendulum has friction,
            then the pendulum will eventually settle down to the bottom equilibrium.
            This motivates the idea of <b>Lyapunov functions</b>, which are energy-like
            functions that can be used to describe the behavior of the system more broadly than
            just around fixed points. The idea is to find a scalar function for the system which is non-negative
            and zero only at equilibrium; then, depending on the time derivative of the Lyapunov function,
            we can start drawing conclusions about the system's behavior.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'll first need some definitions. We say that a scalar function $V(x)$ is
            <b>locally positive definite</b> if within some ball $B_R$, $V(x) \geq 0$ with
            $V(x) = 0 \leftrightarrow x=0$. If the function $V(x) = 0$ at other $x \neq 0$,
            we say that the point is <b>locally positive semi-definite</b>. If $R = \infty$,
            then we say the function is globally positive definite or globally positive semi-definite,
            respectively. (Globally) negative and negative semi-definite functions are defined
            similarly. We say that a scalar function $V(x)$ is a <b>Lyapunov function</b> if (a) $V(x)$ is
            locally positive definite, (b) $V(x)$ has continuous partial derivatives and (c)
            its time derivative $\dot{V}(t)$ is negative semi definite. If we can define a Lyapunov function
            for a system around equilibrium points, we can start to make claims about the stability
            of the equilibria.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Theorem:</b> If a system has a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ defined around equilibrium point $x=0$
            (if equilibrium is not at 0, perform a coordinate transform), then the equilibrium point
            is stable. If the Lyapunov function's time derivative $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite,
            then the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Proof:</b> Consider the first case i.e. $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative semi-definite. We want
             to show that $x=0$ is stable, which means showing that $\forall R > 0, \exists r < R$ such that
            $||x(0)|| < r \Rightarrow ||x(t)|| < R$. Find the minimum of $V(x)$ on the ball $B_R$.
            Since $V(x)$ is positive definite, $V(x) = 0$ only at 0 and positive elsewhere. Since $V(x)$
            is continuous and negative semi-definite, there must exist a ball $B_r$ around $V(x)$ such that
            the maximum of $V(x)$ on $B_r$ is equal to the minimum of $V(x)$ on $B_R$. Then, provided
             a point starts within $B_r$, since $V(x)$ cannot increase, the point cannot escape $B_R$
            since this would require having a larger $V(x)$ than it starts with. The physical intuition is that
            the minimum $V(x)$ on $B_R$ determines an energy threshold. We then find the region entirely below
            this energy threshold (which is guaranteed to exist because $V(x)$ is continuous and $V(0) = 0$),
            and since energy can't increase, we know points within this interior region are trapped below
            the energy threshold.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Proof:</b> Consider the second case i.e. $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite. We want to
            show that $x=0$ is asymptotically stable, which means showing that $||x(0)|| < r_0 \Rightarrow
            ||x(t)|| \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
