# Polya Urn Scheme

__Parent__: [Stochastic Processes](../stochastic_processes.md)

The Polya urn scheme is intuitively described as an urn filled with balls
that are each one of two colors (e.g. black or white). A ball is sampled,
its color recorded, and the ball plus another ball of the sampled ball's color is
placed back in the urn. A sample from this stochastic process is the
sequence of colors of balls.


## Relation to Other Processes

### Blackwell MacQueen Urn Scheme

The [Blackwell MacQueen Urn Scheme](blackwell_macqueen_urn_scheme.md)
generalized the Polya urn scheme to an infinite number of colors.
