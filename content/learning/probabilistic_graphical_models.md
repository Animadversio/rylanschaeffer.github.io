# Probabilistic Graphical Models

## Overview

A joint distribution over $$N$$ variables $$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N can permit complicated relationships
between the variables. One general principle is that performing inference
becomes easier in the absence of relationships between variables. This motivates
us to specify relationships between variables as a graphs and then use the graph
structure to design efficient inference algorithms.
