### Cauchy Sequences

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence in a metric space such that subsequent elements
become arbitrarily close to one another. Formally, a sequence of real numbers
$$(a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$$ is Cauchy if $$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists n \in
\mathbb{N}$$ such that $$\forall j, k > n$$,

$$|a_j - a_k| < \epsilon$$
