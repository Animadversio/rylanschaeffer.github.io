## Learning at Harvard and MIT in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

### Monday

Total work time: 

(Ila IBL): I kicked off the morning to meet with Ila. On the IBL mouse hierarchical inference task,
I made progress on visualizing the logistic regression decoders in our outstanding 
little mouse (the one I call our superstar). I'll be presenting those plots to the 
IBL Theory working group (WG) to get their thoughts. I learned today that the Theory WG
is using a particular set of criteria (>90% accuracy on easy trials, more than 400 trials
per session) when deciding whether to include mice in the analysis. I couldn't find a clear
reasoning, but thankfully people seem open to reevaluating.

(Hilbert) Vincent and I met with a Tenancy in Common real estate agent (Lauran Biedenharn).
She was an absolute delight. She knew so much about the industry and provided us with such
great insights that we're now considering adding her to the team.

(6.438) Continued working on pset 4. Attended office hours. Not much else to report.

(Cengiz DRL): Derived a comparison of the expectation student and the distributional 
student in the single layer, linear case. Akhilan gave an interesting talk on tools
that might be useful.

Went running for 70 minutes. Dad made delicious ramen tonight. Such a nice surprise
to come home to.
