My maternal grandfather passed away today. Robert (Bob) William Schneider, 
September 9, 1935 to October 13, 2020. My mother wanted to write his obituary as 
she did with her mother, but we learned my grandfather had arranged his obituary years ago.
[His obituary](https://www.cozinememorial.com/obituary/Robert-Schneider) was 
posted online by the memorial group he had chosen:

<blockquote>

 license became a flight instructor.

To be honest, I don't remember much about my grandfather. I know he cheated on my maternal grandmother. 
He left California when my she died and I was 7. He moved across the country to marry someone else
without warning. He broke my mother's heart.
For the past decade, he's been in a nursing home with progressively
worsening Alzheimer's. Years ago, he used to say that if he was ever a vegetable, he'd rather be killed.
 Instead, we kept him alive to the point that he was eating his teeth. The lessons I learned from him 
 and his actions:

1. Don't abandon your children or your family.
2. Invest in real estate. It's the only thing they can't make more of.
3. If you don't want to live without a brain for a decade, (a) make this clear to your children
and your attorney, and (b) live someplace with physician-assisted suicide.
