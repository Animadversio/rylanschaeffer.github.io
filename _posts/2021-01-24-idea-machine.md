### Insights While Cycling

I picked up cycling seriously at the onset of Covid because it was a convenient way to exercise
while also providing an avenue to socialize at a respectable distance. For the past few months, 
I would go riding with Vincent or Francesco, and we would spend the majority of the time chatting.
But this week I went with Dad, and he wanted to __ride__. He said I should easily be able to make it to 
Redwood City and back in an hour and half, so off we went. Without anyone to talk to, I realized
that cycling is a miserable sport for someone trying to escape their own mind. There's nothing to do
but think. While my legs pumped, my mind cycled through numerous topics including: 

1. Why I prefer swimming. It's meditative. Swimming depends significantly on form, which stands in start contrast
   to cycling which requires little-to-no form to get started. While swimming, you focus on your stroke, your pacing,
   your breathing, your positioning. There's no thinking - your brain doesn't have the multitasking power.
   Cycling isn't like this. There's no form. I'm not short of breath. All I can think about is my legs burning. 
   And you can't space out because you might die. On just this ride alone, I almost died twice from my father 
   (a highly experienced cyclist) alone when (a) he turned right without warning while I was drafting behind him,
   and (b) I tried passing him on the left at the exact moment he lost control and swerved left, forcing me into
   the lane as a car was passing.
2. My testicles were killing me afterwards
3. Research supervisors have different prioritization of projects. To them, publishing is worth significantly 
   more than your learning. A student needs to be conscientious of this and push back to find a good compromise.
   
### Rammstein

While I was running, Spotify Radio played the song [Deutschland by Rammstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeQM1c-XCDc).
For some reason, I had the perception that Rammstein was one of the hardest metal bands and had never sampled
their music, but after hearing Deutschland, I was curious. My new favorites are [AÃ¼slander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pat2c33sbog)
and [Mein Herz Brennt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXv31OmnKqQ). Their [Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0NfI2NeDHI)
also strongly reminds me of System of a Down's [Radio/Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvHq4siXbPo).
I tried introducing Dad to Deutschland but I made the mistake of showing him the music video and he couldn't
get past the Nazis. I tried explaining the lyrics to him, specifically the duality of the love-hate relationship
with Germany, but sadly the damage was done.

### Hiking in Montara

I went hiking today with Cameron Cairns, Ashley Hanson and Amelia Helland in Montara. 
Beautiful views over the mist and the ocean.
