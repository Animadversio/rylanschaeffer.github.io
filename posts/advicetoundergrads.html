		<h1>Motivation</h1>
		<p>
			I found out this past weekend that Berkeley CS students have an internal wiki to share advice, insights and resources with each other. Although I'm interested in creating a similar resource, I don't have time currently; I would like for the Davis Computer Science Club (DCSC) to take on such a project, but until then, I want to summarize advice I have for potential, incoming and current students. I hope you enjoy reading this!

		<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Classes"></span>Classes</h1>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			Classes are the bread and butter of your education. They are the basis by which you learn, develop your interests, make friends and receive letters of rec from professors. Choosing classes is not just a question of which classes offered next quarter look interesting to you. Companies and graduate schools are much more interested in someone with specialized knowledge (an expert in one domain) than someone with generalized knowledge (a novice in all domains). The department publishes <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/major-tracks/">"Major Tracks"</a>, course recommendations if you have an area you want to specialize in. For this reason, <b>you should complete your lower division classes (20, 30, 40, 50, 60) as soon as possible</b> so that you can explore before choosing a specialization. The department has default multi-year course plans in the office to give you a sense of what this entails. The major tracks aren't complete, so I recommend scheduling time with professor(s) to get a more complete picture of which courses they recommend.
		</p>

		<p>
			To convey the material that each course aims to teach, the department publishes <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/courses/descriptions/">course descriptions</a>. If you're like me, you'll find that these course descriptions fail in three ways. First, until you've taken a given class, the vocabulary is meaningless. For instance, ECS120 references finite automata, context-free languages, pumping lemmas, reducibility and more; to a student just entering the field, these words are meaningless. Second, courses differ greatly depending on which professor is teaching in a given term. It would be extremely impolitic for the department to advise students which professors to avoid, so I don't blame them, but it leaves students without an effective way of evaluating whether a professor-course pairing is right for them. RateMyProfessor can be helpful, but more often than not, the comments are along the lines of "This professor is mean" or "This professor is an easy grader." If you're interested in taking classes to learn the material, as I believe should always be the case, this information is unhelpful. Third, courses can complement each other in non-obvious ways. For example, ENG6 overlaps substantially with MAT22A, and ECS122A overlaps somewhat with ECS120. Understanding these nuances can increase the educational value one derives by taking these courses concurrently.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following is my attempt to rectify these three failings. For each class, I add an ELI5 description so that incoming/new students can better understand what each class covers. I also add details regarding the comparative strengths and weaknesses of professors, aimed at helping you decide whether a professor-course pairing is right for you. Rather than proceeding in numerical order, I sort the courses by the order that you will take them (because of prerequisites, your first few CS classes will be largely deterministic). Where appropriate, I note when courses complement each other.

		<p>
			In 1954, a famous computer scientist named Alan Turing wrote an article in Science News in 1954 titled "Solvable and Unsolvable Problems." Although he wasn't intending to write a course description for ECS120, he basically did.  He tells the reader to imagine being given a puzzle (a crossword, a Rubik's cube, the Riemann Hypothesis, etc.) to solve. If you don't know how to solve it, you might ask if a solution exists. If a solution does exist, you might want to know how hard (computationally) it is to find that solution. For an addition problem, a computer can produce the sum in a flash. But for other problems, a computer might take a very long time to find a solution, or in some cases, might be unable to even determine whether a solution exists! ECS120 gives you a formal way to categorize problems based on how difficult they are to solve. Along the way, you'll learn about different computational models (abstract ways of thinking about how a computer works) and reducibility (the idea that you can prove two problems are equivalent by "reducing" each problem to the other).

		<h3>You Can Teach!</h3>
		<p>
			Since the 60s, Berkeley has a program called <a href="http://www.decal.org/">DeCal</a> which enables students to design and teach ad hoc courses to other students for academic credit. As of May 2014, Davis approved similar <a href="http://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/committees/committee-list/coci/policies-and-procedures.cfm#studentfac">student-led courses</a>. Although the process for planning and approval is still being established, if you're an undergraduate, you can design and teach your own course!
		</p>
		<h3>Why Teach?</h3>
		<p>
			If you're thinking that you have no interest in teaching a class, I urge you to reconsider. Designing and teaching your own class has a number of benefits that cannot be easily obtained by other means.  Such benefits include:
			<ul>
				<li>Learning a subject beyond what classes can offer</li>
				<li>Working one-on-one with a professor, something that rarely happens, even with research</li>
				<li>Developing communication and classroom leadership skills amongst your peers</li>
				<li>Enhancing the overall educational experience for other UCD students</li>
				<li>Enabling you to view one aspect of the life of professors, beyond what a day of shadowing might teach</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		<h3>How to Teach</h3>
		<p>
			To be clear, you are not teaching an already existing class. You are designing your own unique class to complement already existing classes. Choosing a topic is difficult. The topic you choose must have several properties:

			<ul>
				<li>Interesting: the topic must be interesting to both you and your students.</li>
				<li>Useful: Studying Babbage's difference engine might be intellectually interesting, but without modern-day applications, the course will not likely be approved.</li>
				<li>Relevant: It must be related to the department. One could make the case for a Kiswahili class, but the CS department will tell you to find another home for it.</li>
				<li>Unique: Your course cannot overlap with other courses, both inside of and outside of the department.</li>
				<li>Manageable: your course will likely be 1-2 units, meaning the amount of material you cover should be scaled appropriately.</li>
			</ul>

			Second, you must find an instructor of record (the technical term for a professor or lecturer) who will help you prepare the course and supervise from behind the scenes. The program coordinators are terrified something like what happened at Berkeley will happen here, and rightly so (at Berkeley, apparently a bunch of guys took a "Male Sexualities" class and spent every class period at strip clubs). Before approaching your instructor of record, you should be prepared with a few things:
			
			<ul>
				<li>An explanation of the program. Most professors won't have heard about it, so they'll want to know what it is and how they can learn more about it from an authoritative source.</li>
				<li>A argument for why they should spend their limited time suppoting your course. You need to argue (1) that student-led seminars augment the educational experience, (2) your course is worth teaching, and (3) they are the best professor for your particular course. If it's not obvious, you should not approach professors randomly!</li>
				<li>Evidence of your relevant expertise. Professors do not want to babysit you, so convince them that you know the material you want to teach.</li>
				<li>A tentative course syllabus and tenative course materials (assignments, readings, etc.). This shows that you have carefully considered how you plan on structuring and teaching the course. Ideally, you found similar courses at other universities and used them to create your class.</li>
			</ul>

			If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have or speak to a professor on your behalf.
