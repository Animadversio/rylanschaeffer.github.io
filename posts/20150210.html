Jon Stewart announced today that he plans to end his seventeen year stretch as the host of The Daily Show at the end of the year.  TDS holds a special place in my heart, and I am extremely disappointed to see him leave.  My two best high school friends and I bonded through memorizing his witty quips and infrequent yet powerful monologues.  He (along with Colbert) were influential in developing my sense of humor, and I wrote about the two for UWP (University Writing Program) 101:

"Tuesday through Friday, I’d get home from school and kick back on a couch to watch The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. Each day, Jon Stewart educated me about my world while providing hilarious accompanying commentary. From Indecision 2012 to Mess O’Potamia, from Barack Obama to Bassem Youssef, I watched every clip and every interview. I laughed at his flawless timing, his perfect delivery, his honest content. Sometimes he would launch into lengthy tirades.  Other times, he would raise an eyebrow.  Yet whatever he did was sufficient to carry his message.  I came to idolize him as he demolished the foolish, the inept, and the corrupt, arguing in favor of rationality and consistency.  His defense of civil liberties and his calls for holding banking institutions accountable and limiting Executive overreach resonated with me."

That said, I am also grateful to see Stewart leave.  Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear  revealed to me that Stewart was not an agent for change, but dependent on the system he mocked daily.  As Steve Almond wrote in "The Joke's On You," referring to Stewart and Colbert, "Our high-tech jesters serve as smirking adjuncts to the dysfunctional institutions of modern media and politics, from which all their routines derive. Their net effect is almost entirely therapeutic: they congraulate viewers for the fine habits of thought and feeling while remaining careful never to question the corrupt precepts of the status quo too vigorously."  With his and Colbert's departure, I am hopeful for a braver generation of comedians.

The last thing I'll say on the subject of Stewart's departure is that it is a sobering reminder of our mortality.  These days, whenever a famous retired comedian passes away, I always wonder who they were and what they were famous for.  In twenty or thirty years from now, others will be in my place, wondering just who Jon Stewart was.
