		<h1>Alexander Coward</h1>
		<p>
            Freshman year, I took Math 21C (one of four in the engineering calculus series) with Prof. <a href="http://www.alexandercoward.com/">Alexander Coward</a>. I was unfamiliar with proofs, so I emailed him asking for help: "Thanks for helping me work through the proof of the limit comparison test today.  While it was definitely helpful, I still feel woefully incompetent when it comes to proving a theorem.  What I want to know is if you have any suggestions for ways to improve on proofs.  Obviously I can systematically go through the book and prove every theorem we cover, but I was wondering if there's some way I can make such a task more productive/educational."      
        </p>

        <p>
            I have never again had a professor respond the way that he did. He didn't reply to my email. Instead, at the next lecture, he asked if I was in class. He explained the question that I had asked. He explained that proofs are intrinsically hard and that no procedure exists for proving or disproving every possible statement. He told us stories about struggling for years with a single problem, having some very good ideas, but being unable to solve his problem. It was an unparalleled educational experience.

            A few weeks ago, I sent him a friend request on Facebook. He accepted. Tonight, he posted a link to an article he wrote titled <a href="http://alexandercoward.com/BlowingTheWhistleOnUCBerkeleyMathematics.html">BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON THE UC BERKELEY MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT</a>. I highly recommend that you read it as it speaks to my own personal experiences with faculty avoiding pressures to become better teachers.

            I also stumbled across <a href="http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2014-09-02/cal-lecturers-email-students-goes-viral-why-i-am-not">this letter</a> he wrote to his students back in 2013. While the whole letter is worth reading, the following is essential:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "In order for you to navigate the increasing complexity of the 21st century you need a world-class education, and thankfully you have an opportunity to get one. I don't just mean the education you get in class, but I mean the education you get in everything you do, every book you read, every conversation you have, every thought you think.<br><br>

            You need to optimize your life for learning.<br><br>
            You need to live and breath your education.<br><br>
            You need to be *obsessed* with your education."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            His <a href="http://www.alexandercoward.com/teachingstatement.pdf">teaching statement</a> is also worth reading.
